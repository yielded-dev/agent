# Effect Agent PR Review action

This directory contains the GitHub Action contract in `action.yml`. CI builds
the JavaScript bundle and commits it only on distribution tags.

Use `yielded-dev/agent/action@action-v1` for the latest validated release,
or pin the distribution commit SHA reported by CI for an immutable version.
Each release also has an immutable `action-<source-commit-sha>` tag.
New source commits, including `@main`, do not contain a runnable bundle. Switch
to a distribution ref to receive updates. Older SHA pins that contain a bundle
continue to work.

The private
[`@yielded/agent-pr-review-action`](../packages/pr-review-action) workspace
owns the source and tests. The public
[`@yielded/agent-pr-review`](../packages/pr-review) package remains provider-
and transport-neutral.

Build locally with `vp run action:build`. The generated `action/dist/` directory
is ignored by Git. `vp run ready` also builds the Action; no bundle update or
generated-file merge is needed in a source PR.

After a push to `main` passes static checks, tests, and builds, CI publishes that
run's bundle in a child commit of the validated source. It creates the immutable
tag and advances `action-v1` atomically. Failed or superseded runs leave the
previous release available. Publication installs no dependencies and runs no
project code with repository write permission. Package releases remain separate.

## PR check status

Set the same `check-name` for automatic and comment-triggered reviews. In a workflow that
already authorizes review commands, add `checks: write` to its permissions and these inputs:

```yaml
check-name: Effect Agent review
checks-token: ${{ github.token }}
```

`checks-token` defaults to `github-token`. Passing `github.token` separately lets the reviewer
keep its existing GitHub App identity without granting that App Checks write permission.
Omitting `check-name` preserves existing behavior and requires no new permissions.

Each admitted review creates an **in progress** check on the inspected PR head, linked to the
workflow and then the published review. Manual retries replace the displayed result under the
same name; completion updates only that attempt's ID. Keep the per-PR workflow concurrency group.
`@effect-agent review full` starts a new attempt even when automatic reviews are paused.

Put the command on the first nonblank line of a new PR comment. Case, spaces, and tabs
between words are ignored; explanation can follow on later lines:

```text
@effect-agent review full

The production bootstrap finding is now resolved.
```

For review commands, later lines do not change the mode or supply instructions to the reviewer. Quoted
commands, fenced examples, and commands embedded in prose do not start reviews. The workflow
listens for newly created comments, so editing an existing comment does not start another review.

Consumer workflows must admit these comments before the Action can parse them. Keep the PR
and owner/member/collaborator checks, but replace whole-comment equality or a fixed command
prefix with `contains(github.event.comment.body, '@effect-agent')`. Pass the raw body through
`command` and its ID through `comment-id`, as in the [repository workflow](../.github/workflows/pr-review.yml).
The Action skips unsupported mentions before making GitHub or model requests.

Complete reviews without unresolved blockers pass. Blockers and incomplete coverage fail;
a paused, unreviewed commit requires action. Automatic skipped events preserve an existing check
unless trusted history requires an incomplete result; missing checks report trusted review history.
The [dismiss command](#dismissing-a-review) records a reason and refreshes the check in one run.
After using GitHub's **Dismiss review** UI instead, request
`@effect-agent review` on the unchanged head to refresh its check without another model call
or published review. This requires the latest attempt on that head to be complete; an older
completed attempt cannot clear a later incomplete one. `@effect-agent review full` always starts
a fresh assessment. Published review outcomes no longer fail
the workflow job; setup, execution, and check API failures still do.

Cancellation closes the attempt's check when cleanup can run. A push during publication cancels
only the inspected head's check. Check writes time out after ten seconds and are never retried;
runner loss or an uncertain write can leave a check in progress until another review replaces it.

For required reviews, configure branch protection to require this check from its publishing app.
Enabling it does not change branch protection or rewrite old workflow results. A new push after
the workflow upgrade refreshes the PR's workflow job; later manual reviews update the shared check.

### Dismissing a review

Humans and authorized coding agents use the same new PR comment:

```text
@effect-agent dismiss 123456789
The finding assumes a released schema, but that field exists only in an unreleased commit of this PR. The target branch never persisted it.
```

Use the numeric review ID or its full `#pullrequestreview-…` URL. The reason is required on
subsequent lines, up to 1,000 characters. Verify every blocker in the selected review first:
dismissal applies to the **whole review**, including findings with no inline thread. A reason
can establish a fix, refute a finding, or record explicitly accepted risk. Resolving a conversation
does not dismiss its review.

Agents can discover review IDs and findings through the GitHub API and post a file containing
the command above with the CLI:

```sh
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "effect-agent[bot]" and .state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED") | {id, html_url, body}'
gh pr comment NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO --body-file /tmp/review-dismissal.txt
```

Use the configured `review-author` login in the query. Read any inline findings through
`repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews/ID/comments` as needed. The workflow acknowledges the
command with an eyes reaction; confirm the review's `DISMISSED` state and the resulting check.
The check passes only if the latest attempt on the current head is complete and no bot change
requests remain. An unreviewed or incomplete head still needs review; without `check-name`,
it fails the workflow job instead. No model call, new review,
or automatic-review allowance is consumed. Repeating the command safely refreshes the status.

The Action verifies the live comment belongs to this PR, still matches the command, and was
posted by an identity with current repository write access (including maintain/admin). Agents
using a maintainer's authorized GitHub identity need no browser interaction. The existing workflow
must admit that comment. Only this channel's marker-bearing bot reviews can be dismissed; human
and other bots' reviews are untouched. GitHub retains the posting identity, command link, reason,
and inspected commit in the dismissal. A failed API call fails the workflow; if dismissal succeeded
but the check could not refresh, repeat the command or use `@effect-agent review` on a completed head.

## Review behavior

Symlink changes are reviewed as committed target text with Git mode metadata,
including additions, deletions, retargeting, renames, and conversions to or from
regular files. Targets are never followed. Binary filename extensions do not hide
symlink changes; explicit ignore rules still apply. Source tools remain limited
to regular files, and submodules remain unsupported.

The reviewer automatically ignores known binary asset formats, including raster images,
fonts, audio/video, archives, PDFs, and compiled binaries, before fetching their contents.
Other bounded blobs containing NUL bytes are also ignored. These files count as ignored,
not incomplete coverage, and are unavailable to source tools. A binary-only PR needs no
model call. SVG, JSON, XML, and other text assets remain reviewable. API failures, malformed
responses, invalid UTF-8 without NUL bytes, and source-size limits still fail coverage checks.
Binary detection by content retains the existing file and byte read limits.
GitHub reads retry transport errors, incomplete or invalid JSON bodies, timeouts, HTTP 408,
5xx responses, and rate-limited 403/429 responses up to three times. Attempts have a 15-second
timeout, exponential backoff starting at one second, and a shared 90-second read deadline.
Retry-After and rate-limit reset delays are respected; a delay beyond the deadline stops the read
instead of retrying early. Generated-file classification retains its tighter 10-second deadline.
Schema-invalid responses, invalid UTF-8, identity mismatches, and ordinary permission or missing-file
errors fail immediately. Retries use the same immutable blob SHA. GitHub writes are never retried.
Read diagnostics include the operation, attempt, failure category, HTTP status, and GitHub request
ID when available, without response bodies or credentials. Exhausted source reads log the affected
path and revisions and leave coverage incomplete.
When a rename or content replacement crosses between binary and text, the textual side
is still reviewed as an addition or deletion. Explicit ignore rules continue to exclude
an entire rename when either path matches.

One bounded review run sees every admitted changed path, reads complete diffs, and follows affected
callers, contracts, and cleanup paths through immutable base and head source. Small diffs are supplied
directly; larger diffs are available through bounded `read_diff` pages in the same conversation.
Literal code search locates relevant source without requiring the reviewer to guess filenames.
The host tracks unread diff ranges, validates finding paths and
RIGHT-side anchors and publishes against the inspected head. A stopped run preserves findings
recorded before research ended. Preparation failures publish a failure marker. Blocking findings
request changes and fail the Action after publication; other outcomes remain comments.
With `check-name` configured, published review outcomes instead determine the shared PR check
described above.

The reviewer also receives attributed PR comments, inline discussion, and reasons for this bot's
dismissed reviews. It verifies that evidence against source and contracts; a comment or dismissal
does not establish correctness or authorize another dismissal. The Action requests the latest
20 issue comments, 20 review threads with up to 10 comments each, and 20 dismissal events. It keeps
the newest 60 entries within 32,000 serialized characters, clipping each body at 4,000 characters.
Uncorrelated dismissal events and omitted or clipped context are marked partial; a failed or
mismatched response is marked unavailable. A missing review commit does not exclude otherwise
attributable dismissal evidence.
The source tools read committed Git files and do not install dependencies.

Set `web-search: "true"` (local `PR_REVIEW_WEB_SEARCH=true`) to let the reviewer
search and open public documentation through OpenAI's hosted web tool. It is off
by default. Queries should contain public API names and versions, never repository
source or private values. External evidence remains untrusted, and findings that
depend on it must cite a public URL. The review footer and `web-search-calls` output
count billed searches; opening or finding text within a page is not a billed search.

Reviews with findings include a **Copy all findings** dropdown. Expand it and use the code
block's copy button to copy every finding from that review, including paths, inline line numbers
when available, and the inspected commit. The block reminds coding agents to verify findings
before making changes. It opens by default when any finding has no inline comment.

A complete incremental or full pass with no new blockers can dismiss this bot's earlier change
requests when every blocker in each selected review is verified as fixed, refuted, or obsolete
against current source and applicable contracts. An incorrect premise can be refuted by unchanged
code. The dismissal records the inspected commit and evidence. A revised PR description, clean
delta, changed line, resolved conversation, or commit message alone does not clear earlier feedback.
Acceptance of a still-valid risk requires an authorized maintainer's dismissal command. Human and
other bots' reviews are never dismissed.

Unresolved-review notices link to the original reviews with their dates, inspected commits,
and available blocker titles, separately from new findings. They show up to eight reviews and
three blocker titles per review, subject to space remaining after the current findings; open
the linked review or the pull request's review history for complete feedback.

Incremental passes revisit unresolved reviews, including body-only findings and findings on paths
outside the latest delta. A fix retained because its pass found a new blocker can be verified again
on a later pass even when the original path no longer changes. This verification does not expand
new-defect discovery beyond the delta. New findings must identify a change since the last completed
review that introduced or newly exposed the defect; a missed older issue is outside that scope.
Use `@effect-agent review full` to request a fresh assessment of the whole admitted PR diff.
At most eight prior reviews are considered, each with its complete review body and bot comments
within 32,000 characters. Oversized feedback stays blocking; it is never truncated for verification.
Follow-up verification shares the same conversation and spending and execution
limits. Incomplete, exhausted, excluded-path, or newly blocking results dismiss nothing.
The Action rechecks review ownership, feedback, and head before each dismissal. GitHub does not
support a conditional dismissal, so a push can still race the final API request. Dismissals happen
before the new comment is posted; if a later API call fails, the Action fails and any completed
dismissals retain their evidence in GitHub. A failed dismissal records an incomplete attempt when
GitHub still accepts review comments, so it consumes the automatic allowance. Retry with a full
review or inspect and dismiss manually.

Automatic waves use the configured limit, defaulting to two; this repository allows five.
Zero disables automatic reviews. Rerunning the workflow can retry an incomplete review on the same
head while automatic attempts remain. Each published attempt consumes that allowance; incomplete
attempts never become incremental baselines. Once the allowance is exhausted, an incomplete head
continues to fail until a manual review completes. Automatic mode still skips completed heads.
Only trusted bot-authored terminal markers count. Failed attempts count but cannot become diff
baselines. An owner, member, or collaborator can request `@effect-agent review` for incremental
review or `@effect-agent review full` for the whole admitted diff. Manual waves do not consume the
automatic allowance. If a rebase changes the merge base, automatic mode reviews the full diff
from the current merge base in the same attempt, under the same spending ceiling. It labels the
result as a full review; this fallback does not reset the automatic allowance. Explicit incremental
requests still stop when their baseline is missing or its merge base changed. Incomplete repository
comparisons fail in every mode. The workflow runs trusted default-branch code, serializes attempts,
and refuses stale findings. If a push makes an attempt stale before publication, the Action logs
the inspected and current commits and posts only an incomplete notice bound to the inspected commit.
The stale attempt counts toward the automatic allowance, but cannot mark the new commit as already
attempted. The queued review can proceed while allowance remains. The attempt logs failure types;
budget failures include the exhausted limit and observed usage.
Failure comments on an unchanged head also report budget exhaustion without exposing provider
diagnostics or model output.

The host enforces the spending allowance before each request. The reviewer can explicitly report
unfinished coverage while preserving established findings. If turn, tool, or cost limits stop
research, the Action publishes established findings with an incomplete-coverage warning and fails
the check, including when no defects were found. Such an attempt cannot become
an incremental baseline or clear an earlier change request. This preserves useful findings without
claiming the full change was reviewed.
The reviewer refuses early completion while admitted diffs remain unread. A model-reported
`blockedOn` reason names specific unavailable evidence and is retained in an incomplete result.
The Action
separately lists excluded paths and their reasons, including input limits, unreadable source, and
diffs that were not read completely. Excluded paths prevent a complete review even when assessment of the
supplied patches completes. The comment shows up to 30 exclusions; the Action log includes all of
them. Paths excluded only by input capacity remain available to bounded source tools, while ignore
rules and unsupported or unreadable entries continue to block access.

Source search uses a case-sensitive literal query and a path substring at either exact revision.
Each page scans up to 20 authorized regular files, with four concurrent reads, and returns at most
five matching lines per file. Snippets retain the complete query within 200 characters. A next
cursor identifies more files; `truncated` identifies omitted matching lines, and unreadable paths
are listed separately. A partial search cannot establish that no callers exist. Ignore rules,
binary exclusions, and symlink restrictions apply equally to reads, filename search, and code search.

### Generated files

Modified and deleted generated files are ignored before reading their contents, using GitHub's
classification at the trusted PR merge base. Removing their attributes or ignore rules in the PR
does not change that classification, including during incremental reviews. New paths, renames,
permission changes, and unsupported entries follow normal admission rules. Classification failures
leave the review incomplete.
Classification attempts have a separate 100-file limit. Ignored generated files do not consume
review capacity. After that limit, remaining files follow normal admission rules without automatic
generated-file exclusion.

## Spending and prompt caching

Review attempts default to a configurable **$2.50 maximum**. Set the Action's `max-cost-usd`
input or local `PR_REVIEW_MAX_COST_USD` environment variable to a value from $0.01 to $100.
The base defaults to **$1**. Set `base-cost-usd` or local `PR_REVIEW_BASE_COST_USD` to a value
from $0.01 to $100. The allowance is **base plus $1 per 100,000 characters** in admitted patches
and selected prior feedback and discussion, capped at the maximum even when the base exceeds it.
For example, 10,000 characters allow $1.10, 50,000 allow
$1.50, and 150,000 or more allow $2.50 with the default configuration. Ignored and excluded
files do not increase the allowance. Empty or skipped reviews have a zero allowance.
Validated source-map JSON payloads omitted from dependency patches do not increase it either.
The footer, logs, and `cost-limit-usd` output show the actual scaled allowance, including
both settled charges and outstanding reservations. The same policy applies to full reviews,
incremental reviews, and eval trials; a retry gets a new allowance.

With `base-cost-usd: "4.00"` and `max-cost-usd: "20.00"`, 10,000 characters allow $4.10
and 1,600,000 or more allow $20. These are per-attempt allowances, not a cumulative PR limit.

Every consumer must specify `model` (or local `PR_REVIEW_MODEL`); there is no fallback.
Missing, blank, and unpriced models fail before paid inference. Reasoning effort defaults to
`medium` and accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`.
Omit `priority` to omit the API's `service_tier` parameter and inherit the OpenAI project setting.
Set `priority: default` to force Standard processing, or `priority: fast` (local
`PR_REVIEW_PRIORITY=fast`) to request [OpenAI Fast mode](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/fast-mode).
Fast is supported for the listed models, subject to account and regional availability.
Fast mode costs twice the standard token rates for the supported models and uses the same
size-scaled spending cap, so the allowance buys fewer tokens. The @yielded/agent repository's
workflow opts into Fast mode with `base-cost-usd: "20.00"` and `max-cost-usd: "25.00"`;
its allowance still scales with PR size.
Requests with omitted priority reserve at Fast rates because the project setting can enable Fast.
Explicit priorities reserve at the selected tier's rates, and settlement uses the tier reported by OpenAI,
including standard-rate fallback from Fast mode. Both `fast` and `priority` response tags identify
Fast pricing. Unknown response tiers retain their reservation and stop the attempt. Rejected
requests are not retried at another tier; the selected model and effort stay unchanged.

```yaml
- uses: yielded-dev/agent/action@action-v1
  with:
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    pull-request: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    model: gpt-6-astra
    effort: medium # Optional; this is the default.
    priority: fast
```

**BEHAVIOR CHANGE:** Add an explicit `model`. Replace `fast: "true"` with `priority: fast`;
use `priority: default` to retain explicitly Standard processing.

It accepts GPT-6 Astra, Sol, and Luna. The Standard and Fast rate cards were verified on
2026-09-22. See [OpenAI pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing).

Before each research, compaction, or completion request, the Action uses OpenAI's
[input-token counting endpoint](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/token-counting) on the
encoded input, tools, reasoning, and output-format settings. It rejects inputs above 128,000 tokens,
then reserves every input token at the cache-write rate plus the full output allowance, including
reasoning. Admission never assumes a cache hit. The ledger releases unused reservations only after
validating the response's usage, model, tier, and reserved bounds. Failed, interrupted, or unmetered
requests retain their possible charge; the transport does not automatically retry them.

With web search enabled, each response requests a limit of eight hosted web actions. A response
that exceeds the admitted bounds stops the review as incomplete and retains its reservation.
The model may continue searching or opening pages in later turns. Because preflight cannot count
retrieved text, admission reserves the full 128,000-token search context at the
cache-write rate, plus eight $0.01 searches and the output allowance. Settlement charges
observed tokens and searches within the same spending cap. This conservative reserve
can stop a review while some allowance remains. Exact-function finalization uses the
ordinary counted reservation. Search pricing follows
[OpenAI's built-in tool rates](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing#built-in-tools).

Character admission does not guarantee a token fit. If the engine's context estimate or the
provider's exact count exceeds the input limit, the Action publishes an incomplete token-budget
result, preserves earlier findings, and lists unread diffs as unreviewed. A refusal
before the first model call reports zero spend and reserves nothing. The attempt stops without
truncating patches or retrying paid inference.

The non-inference token count has a 10-second timeout per attempt and retries at most once for
timeouts, transport failures, or HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504. Other HTTP failures and
malformed counts fail immediately. Exhausted preflight fails closed before spending admission;
it never authorizes an uncounted request. Cancellation interrupts the active attempt without a
retry. Diagnostics report only the preflight phase, attempt, failure category, HTTP status, and
bounded provider request ID when available.
Paid inference is never automatically retried.

Spending balances and reservations remain in the host's admission ledger and logs. They are not
appended to the review conversation as user requests. Remaining-turn and tool counters are not
presented as a research target. Their safety limits still apply.

The output allowance starts at 32,000 tokens and is reduced before each request when needed to fit
the remaining balance. Research can continue with that smaller allowance; the model, reasoning
effort, tool definitions, and tool choice stay unchanged. Logs show the requested and admitted
output allowances. If a response is truncated by the cost limit, or no further request fits, the
host delivers already recorded findings without another paid call and reports incomplete coverage.
Large changes may therefore remain incomplete under the ceiling. An incomplete empty result is
labeled `None recorded · incomplete`, never given a green check or counted as a successful review.

This is a client admission guarantee under the pinned pricing and token-count contracts, not an
invoice audit or an OpenAI account spending limit. Usage estimates remain separate from outstanding
reservations. Expected model or validation failures after a provider attempt retain an incomplete
report with those diagnostics even when no finding was recorded. Each review's logs and footer
show model calls, ordinary input, cache reads, cache writes, output, cache-hit ratio, and estimated
cost. Provider failures identify the model call, request or stream phase, typed reason, transport
category, HTTP status, and bounded request ID when available. Admission refusals use fixed host
messages to distinguish invalid usage or pricing contracts from network failures. Raw provider
failure causes, response bodies, credentials, and repository source are excluded from diagnostics.
Stream error events log a recognized public provider error code or `unrecognized`, alongside the
request ID. Error messages and parameters remain excluded. A provider error event can surface as
`ModelProtocolError` in the review summary; inspect the provider-event log to distinguish it from
an interpreter protocol failure. Such events do not trigger a paid retry.
Navigation logs show read offsets, fully repeated pages, discarded reads at rollover, remaining
coverage, note-update counts, and compaction counts. Policy failures name the exhausted limit;
deadline stops also identify the five-minute limit in the published review. Logs also count supplied tool
definitions, returned function calls, and completion calls to diagnose protocol failures.
Admission logs identify the requested model and reasoning effort. Usage logs retain the returned
model, reasoning-token count when supplied, and incomplete reason. Missing reasoning counts remain
unmeasured; the logs never include reasoning content.

Within `.patch` files, the Action replaces single-line source-map JSON payloads in
valid nested `.map` diffs with explicit omission markers before model input and spending
admission. It recognizes the source-map structure, not arbitrary generated-file comments.
Patch headers, outer hunk coordinates, nested line prefixes, and source changes are retained.
The report discloses omitted payload lines and character counts separately from assessed
content. Malformed patches, unrecognized JSON, indexed or multiline maps, and non-map
sections remain literal evidence. Source tools still allow targeted inspection when needed;
the Action does not change repository files or automatically skip entire dependency patches.

The Action admits implementation and configuration changes before documentation paths and prose,
with alphabetical order within each group. One review conversation retains the complete changed-path
manifest and established findings, so related changes stay visible across the investigation. Diffs
up to 32,000 total characters appear directly in the initial prompt; larger changes use `read_diff`
pages of up to 32,000 characters. Pages can cross file boundaries, so reviewing many small files does
not require a separate call for each file. Every retained patch line remains available in full. One spending ledger,
5-minute deadline, and 24-finding capacity cover the entire attempt. Finite backstops of 4,096 model
turns and 16,384 tool calls bound runaway loops within that deadline. Findings survive an expected
execution failure. The reviewer's [history capacity limits](../packages/pr-review/README.md#coverage-and-limits)
also apply. Unread diff ranges prevent complete coverage;
reading every range is necessary but does not prove the model finished assessing the change.

The native Agent input projection uses literal unified diff text, avoiding JSON-escaped source and
duplicated old/new context. A large remaining input can still prevent another call before the observed spend reaches
the allowance, because admission must cover a cache miss. Refusal logs report the counted input, remaining
balance, and minimum possible request reservation. The Action's spending admission replaces the
reviewer's cumulative token quota, so reusing cached context does not force early finalization.
Spending admission is the primary budget for diff navigation and research. The five-minute
deadline and native rollover at a 128,000-token working context still apply; the provider's separate
exact-input admission boundary remains 128,000 tokens.

The Action uses explicit-only caching with a 30-minute TTL and a stable head-based routing key.
It marks reusable instructions, the diff, and completed tool batches, retaining earlier boundaries
as history grows. Cache fields are added only at the native
Effect OpenAI client boundary; canonical history and provider encoding remain unchanged. This works
with the pinned Effect `4.0.0` client, which serializes the additional request fields unchanged.
Required finalization selects `submit_review` through the native exact-tool choice, preserving
the research tool definitions and their order in the encoded request.
Compaction can change prefixes, and routing and cache availability still affect hits. See
[OpenAI prompt caching](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching).

Input admission allows at most 1,000 usable files, 2,000,000 characters per patch, 8,000,000 patch
characters in total, and 16 MB of hydrated base/head source. Failed, unsupported, and oversized
candidates do not consume usable file slots. A file that exceeds the remaining source or patch
allowance is excluded without preventing smaller later files from fitting. These bounds
limit input preparation independently of the shared inference spending ceiling.

The source cache retains at most sixteen verified blobs, each bounded to 2 MB. Evicted source is
read again by its immutable blob SHA, so repository-wide searches do not retain the entire tree.
