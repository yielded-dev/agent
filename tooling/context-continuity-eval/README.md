# Context continuity evaluation

A real OpenAI model maintains one evolving project across 13 user updates and at least 12 native
rollovers. The model uses public context-history and durable-notes tools. The host never supplies
a summary or restores notes into the prompt for it. Reference answers stay outside model context.

All live profiles keep the same corrected-decision, unfinished-work, bounded-notes, exact-receipt,
original-source, and window-age checks. Receipt codes vary by seed. Delayed lookups must search and
read original retained evidence, including a source covered by ten windows, whose answer is absent
from notes and the current prompt. Citation chains are allowed; citing a recent recollection alone
fails. No second model awards a subjective score.
The oracle identifies the original from the accepted archive input and its first canonical model
response. An aged copied tool result or later transcript cannot substitute for that source.

| `pressure-restart-sqlite-v1`            | Two synthetic manifest pages create pressure at 16k. `new_context` is unavailable. Native compactor observations must match committed windows.

| `production-capacity-v1`                | `--validate` prepares the scalable manifest workload and input-cost planning for an explicit application context limit.                                                                                      | Preparation only: live dispatch is disabled.

The pressure workload fills the window with synthetic tool observations; this is deliberately
induced pressure, not a claim that a production conversation naturally accumulated that volume.
The compactor, estimator, original history, and notes implementations remain native. Recovery
boundaries occur immediately before and after a canonical rollover append. Process recovery
reuses persisted usage and refuses any unsettled provider reservation. Cloudflare confirms its
evaluator-state writes before eviction; the next incarnation reads the same native notes revision.

The follow-up includes the native [recovery checkpoint capability from #380](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/380).
`ThreadStore.recoveryCheckpoints` is an optional, latest-only cache bound to a canonical batch tail;
it is separate from this evaluator's `resume.json` and Cloudflare audit/phase bookkeeping. Native
recovery validates the cache and replays its suffix, or falls back to complete canonical replay
when the cache is absent, rejected or incompatible. The canonical log and submission ledger
remain authoritative. The evaluator observes public cache metadata in `recovery-checkpoint.json`
(SQLite) or `host-snapshot.json` (Cloudflare), distinguishing missing/rejected caches from storage
failures. It keeps the full canonical transcript and original-source oracle independent of that cache.

The deterministic SIGKILL and workerd tests require a valid native checkpoint covering the last
committed rollover, alongside the existing recovery, usage and original-history checks. Checkpoint
presence does not establish fast-path selection, bounded startup work, or latency/CPU improvement.
Actual hosted Cloudflare invocation latency and CPU remain open under
[#356](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/issues/356). The green live baseline in #372 is tied
to `ad4b70a557b6e561e8471eae2fd3b57373bfdb3b`, before #380, and provides no live acceptance claim
for this newer source. Workspace-source verification does not establish beta64 publication; the
release coordinator owns that receipt. No paid profile runs solely because a runtime merge lands.

Run `vp run context-continuity-eval --help` for configuration. One bounded live attempt:

```sh
EFFECT_AGENT_LIVE=1 vp run context-continuity-eval --require-clean --model gpt-6-astra \
  --profile pressure-restart-sqlite-v1 --max-cost-usd 10 --output-dir /tmp/context-eval-1
```

Supply `OPENAI_API_KEY` through the environment or an existing `--env-file`. Each attempt needs a
new output directory. The CLI checks source identity before and after a run. `--validate` makes no
model calls and cannot pass the live gate. Preserve failures; rerunning adds evidence rather than
repairing the first result. Never repeat an unchanged candidate just to get a passing sample.

Nightly and confirmed-unpublished-release jobs continue to run exactly the existing default
profile with a $10 ceiling. Manual Actions dispatch can select one bounded SQLite profile. There
is no paid PR trigger or profile matrix. Cloudflare and production-capacity runs are not added to
automatic jobs. Published versions skip evaluation/publication; registry errors fail closed.

For a Cloudflare host, build from a clean candidate with
`vp run -F @yielded/agent-example-context-continuity-eval build`. The bundle embeds its commit and
clean/dirty state. `wrangler.jsonc` is a deployment template for a separately selected account and
evaluation Worker. Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `CONTEXT_EVAL_TOKEN` as secrets. Deployment is an
explicit operation; the build and runner never deploy. The live runner requires an already deployed
HTTPS endpoint, the same exact clean source, model, seed 17, low effort, and $10 cap:

```sh
EFFECT_AGENT_LIVE=1 vp run context-continuity-eval --require-clean --model gpt-6-astra \
  --profile pressure-cloudflare-v1 --cloudflare-url https://YOUR-EVAL-WORKER.workers.dev \
  --output-dir /tmp/context-eval-cf-1
```

Export the matching `CONTEXT_EVAL_TOKEN` locally. The Worker protects all routes with that token and
uses a fresh Thread for each attempt. The test fixture intercepts all OpenAI traffic and never
contacts a paid endpoint. Its scripted answers live only in `test/`, outside the deployed bundle.

Hosted acceptance needs an explicitly selected isolated account/Worker, deployment credentials,
permission to create its SQLite DO namespace, and an owner for evidence export and teardown.
Existing consumer deployment permission does not select this target. Build and dry-run the exact
reviewed commit, preserve bundle hashes and the deployment/version IDs, then verify the authenticated
host identity before submitting one fresh Thread. A local bundle or dry-run is not deployment proof.

The template enables unsampled invocation logging. Collect Cloudflare's invocation CPU/wall-time
records, request IDs, DO IDs, outcomes and deployment version over the run's UTC interval; confirm
log-query access and units before the attempt. Collect client submit/response and phase-completion
latency separately: Worker wall time includes I/O and is not client response latency. Correlate the
two eviction boundaries with the new incarnations and preserve missing samples as missing evidence.
Namespace CPU aggregates can supplement the report, but cannot isolate a particular recovery.
See Cloudflare's [DO metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/observability/metrics-and-analytics/)
and [Worker metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics-and-analytics/).

Budget hosted continuity separately: one model attempt remains capped at $10, plus an explicit
Cloudflare allowance for invocations, active duration, SQL rows, retained storage and logs. A proposed
15-minute collection window with one active 128-MB DO consumes at most 115.2 GB-s of DO duration
(about $0.00144 at the current marginal rate); this excludes the calling Worker, SQL and logs.
Reserve $1 for those host resources, verify the account's rates/quotas, and stop collection at the
deadline. This is a proposed allowance, not authorization or an enforced Cloudflare billing cap.
Export evidence before deleting the isolated data and deployment; retained storage remains billable.
See [DO pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/pricing/).

The distinct #356 performance case still needs a hosted benchmark adapter for the existing
1k/10k/100k-history recovery workload, with a fixed active suffix and cold/warm cohorts. Keep model
inference out of that benchmark, exclude seeding from recovery timing, and measure canonical reads,
checkpoint selection, invocation CPU and client latency together. The continuity Worker is ready
for isolated deployment preparation; its 12-window run alone does not close this scaling gate.

Prepare a full-capacity workload without inference:

```sh
vp run context-continuity-eval --validate --profile production-capacity-v1 \
  --production-context-tokens 200000
```

Here 200,000 is an illustrative planning target, not a verified production limit. The output shows
manifest sizes and the checked-in price estimate for twelve uncached requests at 80% of that
capacity. For `gpt-6-astra` that input-only scenario is $24 before outputs, repeated history reads,
and recovery; it does not fit the $10 ceiling. Caching may affect actual cost and long-context
pricing needs separate verification. Confirm the real capacity, model, host, and total budget
before enabling a separate full-capacity input ceiling. The existing 32k paid-input guard and $10
per-attempt ceiling stay enforced; selecting this planning profile never bypasses them.

Artifacts include synthetic canonical records, exact outgoing requests, model/source/scenario
identity, cumulative provider usage, conservative estimated cost, assertions, and profile-specific
kill or eviction evidence. Process artifacts also retain SQLite and each barrier's canonical log.
A partial report, provider outage, exhausted budget, missing credential, unsettled reservation, or
failed assertion is a failed gate. Pricing is an estimate, not an invoice. There are no inference
retries or model fallbacks; server-side conversation state and automatic truncation are disabled.

## Manual deployed performance evaluation

`vp run perf:cloudflare` deploys a separate disposable Worker and SQLite Durable Object namespace
and runs real OpenAI inference through the public Thread HTTP/DO path. The dedicated
`Manual Cloudflare performance` workflow accepts exact candidate and optional reference SHAs.
It has only `workflow_dispatch`: PR, push, nightly, and release continuity jobs never select it.
Configure the `performance-cloudflare` GitHub environment with `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secrets, plus the
`CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_SUBDOMAIN` variable. Use a dedicated benchmark account/environment with
Workers/DO deployment and deletion permissions.

Install each checkout with its own lockfile, then run from the candidate checkout:

```sh
vp run perf:cloudflare --dry-run --output-dir .context-continuity-eval/perf-plan

# Export the same four Cloudflare/provider settings listed above.
EFFECT_AGENT_LIVE=1 vp run perf:cloudflare --model gpt-6-astra --samples 1 \
  --reference-root ../reference --output-dir .context-continuity-eval/perf-candidate
```

The optional reference must support the fixture's public APIs. Both bundles use identical fixture
source, with public imports resolved against each clean checkout's own installed dependencies.
Both are minified Workers bundles with the same compatibility date, model settings and limits.
The source commit, fixture/lockfile/bundle digests, deployed version ID and configuration are
retained. A changed checkout or a mismatched deployed identity fails validation. For an isolated
bundle check, use `vp run perf:cloudflare:build --source-root . --output-dir <new-directory>`.

Each sample makes three sequential orders on one thread. The model selects independent price
and stock tools, consumes both results in subsequent inference, and produces a schema-validated
computed order. Assertions require exact totals and current evidence codes, successful canonical
tool records, exactly one durable completion/settlement, and the previous order's total on the
same-thread follow-up. The fresh-thread probe verifies no canonical history, then initializes the
host before submission; it is not a guaranteed cold start. The warm case requires the same observed
incarnation. The recovery case aborts the real DO after confirmed tool-result persistence and
requires a new incarnation, completed follow-up inference, and no repeated committed tool work.
Successful Attempt finalization is checked; native abort does not promise finalizers.
The tool handlers use fixed synthetic price/stock data and each wait 20 ms so their independent
execution is observable. Their latency does not represent an external inventory backend.

Runs allow 1–3 samples per target, one active submission, two concurrent tools, four turns and four
tool calls per submission, two minutes per agent run, and eight minutes per sample. A thread permits
at most 18 model calls, 8,192 input tokens/request, 4,096 output tokens/request, and $2 of conservative
provider reservations. The maximum is $6 per target or $12 for both targets; these estimates exclude
Cloudflare charges. Unmetered/interrupted provider calls retain their reservation and block further
dispatch. No inference is retried. Synthetic data is bounded to three submissions per thread and a
16 MiB database admission limit. Tokens, returned model identities, cache usage, and cost estimates
are in the request/response audits. No API keys or authorization headers enter evidence artifacts.

`report.json`, `summary.md`, per-phase snapshots, and deployment logs retain every sample, including
failures and slow runs. They include admission, queue-to-claim, preparation, input-token preflight,
the actual Fetch dispatch boundary, first provider delta, tool intervals, canonical commits and
client delivery. First client-visible feedback means the first **observed canonical model response**
with 100 ms polling; it does not claim live token streaming. Runner and DO clock domains remain
separate. The [Workers clock only advances after I/O](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/performance/),
so a zero synchronous duration is unresolved at that timer precision. Do not add overlapping spans
or subtract synthetic processing time from provider latency. CPU and heap are explicitly unavailable
from these request APIs; database bytes and ingress CF-Ray location are retained. Attach a separate
Cloudflare observability export when CPU billing evidence is required. DO region and provider cache
state are not controlled. Polling and persisted instrumentation add harness work to both candidates.

Targets alternate by sample without concurrent inference. Timing remains informational: small
sample counts and provider/cache/placement variance are not a latency gate. Successful end-to-end
and lifecycle assertions are a separate pass/fail result. Attach the workflow artifact URL and
`summary.md` to the PR/release for the reported candidate SHA and configuration; evidence from a
different SHA or fixture does not validate a changed candidate. This repository's offline workerd
tests use a scripted transport and are explicitly not live-provider or Cloudflare deployment evidence.

Cleanup runs on success, failure, and interruption. Ownership is persisted before upload, including
ambiguous partial deployments. The command first deploys a
[deleted class tombstone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/)
to remove the entire disposable namespace/data, then deletes the Worker through the Workers API
and verifies its removal. Cleanup requires Workers Scripts permissions; it does not scan KV
namespaces or require KV permissions.
The workflow retries recorded cleanup in an `always()` step. A failed cleanup fails the run and
leaves its exact resource names in `resources.json`; retry using the same account credentials:

```sh
vp run perf:cloudflare --cleanup --output-dir .context-continuity-eval/perf-candidate
```

Hard runner termination can prevent finalizers and the workflow retry; retain the artifact and run
that cleanup command. Every owned target must have `cleanupComplete: true` before closing the run.
Downloaded artifacts can be moved to another machine: cleanup resolves the candidate/reference
folders beneath `--output-dir` and regenerates the fixed deletion configuration from validated
Worker names, rather than using artifact-supplied executable/configuration content.

## Scripted Cloudflare CPU comparison

`vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu` measures replay and compaction without model inference. One
Alchemy stack creates separate disposable baseline, candidate, and identical-code control
stages. Each uses a prebuilt production bundle and its own SQLite Durable Object namespace.
The control uploads the baseline bundle unchanged. This is a distinct workload from the
live-model command above and is never selected by CI automatically.

Build both clean checkouts using their installed lockfiles, then compare:

```sh
vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu:build --source-root ../baseline --output-dir /tmp/cpu-baseline
vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu:build --source-root ../candidate --output-dir /tmp/cpu-candidate
vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu --baseline-dir /tmp/cpu-baseline --candidate-dir /tmp/cpu-candidate \
  --output-dir /tmp/cpu-comparison --dry-run

# Requires CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN with Workers/DO and log-query access.
vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu --baseline-dir /tmp/cpu-baseline --candidate-dir /tmp/cpu-candidate \
  --output-dir /tmp/cpu-comparison
```

The builder runs the package builds and resolves the fixture's public imports to production
exports. It retains source, fixture, lockfile and bundle identities and rejects changed source.
The runner checks bundle digests and deployed identities before submitting work. New Worker
routes get up to 15 read-only readiness probes; benchmark operations are never retried. Dry-run
validates the bundles and prints the experiment; it creates no cloud resources or output files.

The fixed experiment has three deployment rounds, four matched cohorts per round and two
starting archive sizes: 10 and 1,000 canonical records. Its 72 Objects each run two identical
five-step cycles: compaction/reply, fresh reply, fresh reply, compaction/reply, fresh reply.
Each operation uses a 400 KB active context, two scripted model callbacks and two small tools.
A retained random seed determines deployment and sample order before deployment. The run
permits one active operation and stops workload dispatch after 45 minutes. There are 720
measured RPCs and no provider API calls; Cloudflare storage, execution and logs remain billable.
The deadline is a workload bound, not an account billing cap.

The first cycle is **initial after seed**, not a guaranteed cold isolate. The second is
**warmed, same observed incarnation**: module and runtime IDs must stay unchanged. These
IDs do not establish JIT tier, physical host, placement or cache state. Objects can share an
isolate, so phases and Objects are not independent deployment samples. Twenty raw provider
prompts are retained per Object until its final audit; both cycles use this same bounded
retention policy. The warmed cycle also includes the first cycle's canonical records and
retained captures, so it does not isolate JIT warm-up from that accumulated state.

No archive exports, prompt encoding, hashes or checkpoint inspections run between measured
operations. The final audit verifies canonical append digests, retained context, exact finite
model/tool/finalizer counts, settlements and checkpoint presence. Normalized captured prompts
must agree across all roles and archive sizes. This proves durable cross-Run continuity;
existing recovery checks separately cover crashes and ownership loss.

`report.json`, `samples.json`, `table.md`, operation receipts and sanitized invocation exports
retain the results. CPU means Cloudflare's `cpuTimeMs` for the uniquely matched Object RPC
through settlement; ingress CPU and client elapsed time are separate. Missing, duplicate,
truncated or failed invocations cannot become valid samples. Alarm and evidence invocations
remain in the exports and are not added to reply CPU. The primary comparison sums the two
compaction RPCs per Object, with initial and warmed cycles reported separately. Results include
ranges, matched candidate/control ratios and each deployment round. The prespecified comparison
criterion requires a 10% reduction in all three rounds exceeding each identical-code control
shift. Meeting that criterion is not a statistical confidence guarantee; three rounds do not
establish a precise population effect.

Alchemy state and authentication files contain secrets and live in a private temporary
directory outside the artifacts. Ownership is recorded before upload. Success, failure and
interruption destroy recorded stages, then independently verify both Worker and namespace
absence before deleting private state. A hard process kill or failed cleanup can leave that
state and its recovery pointer in `resources.json`; keep them together on the original machine:

```sh
vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu --cleanup --output-dir /tmp/cpu-comparison
```

Close the run only when `cleanup.json` records verified completion. Never upload the private
state directory. Failed samples and incomplete exports remain evidence; the runner does not
replace them or reuse an existing output directory.
