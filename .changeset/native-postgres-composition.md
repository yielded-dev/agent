Compose PostgreSQL storage with an application-provided Effect SQL client and Crypto layer, preserving native connection pooling, codecs, and schema defaults.

BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace the `client` option and `PostgresStorageClient` with `PostgresStorage.layer` (or `layerWith(options)`) and native Layers. Install the service values returned by shared `makeSqlThreadStore` and `makeSqlSubmissionLedger` factories with `Layer.effect` for their corresponding ports; yield `makeSqlQuery(namespace?)` and call shared schema and index creation helpers as functions, optionally supplying a namespace.
