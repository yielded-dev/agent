/**
 * P7 WP2 — `certifyDurableAdapters` (plan §1): the one certification entry point a durable
 * adapter pair runs to earn a Schema-encoded certificate.
 *
 * - **Tier 1 — port contract**: the two shared conformance case arrays, verbatim, through
 *   `certifyPorts` (TEST-004/STORE-010).
 * - **Tier 2 — coordinator protocol + failpoint convergence**: the durable coordinator is
 *   assembled over the CANDIDATE Layer pair with a scripted deterministic model; every
 *   reached `DurableRuntimeFailpointLocation` is armed one-shot across the six scenario shapes
 *   (plain / uncertain-tool / durable-steps / approval / join / delegation). Unreached locations
 *   share a verified clean run per shape; new unaccounted-for locations get a full sweep.
 *   After the injected fault the runner asserts the state stays CLASSIFIABLE (recovery +
 *   the public unblocking operations `resolveUnknown`/`resolveApproval` are the only levers
 *   used) and that the re-drive CONVERGES to `verifyThreadInvariants` with `requireAllSettled`,
 *   including the complete canonical digest chain from native paged verification.
 * - **Tier 3 — real loss lever**: recorded honestly. A durable adapter either supplies a
 *   `CertificationCrashLever` executed in this run, cites its committed real-loss evidence
 *   (process-kill / eviction suites), or the certificate says `not-exercised`. A non-durable
 *   reference adapter records `not-applicable`.
 *
 * The runner is adapter-neutral and platform-neutral: it imports nothing Node-only, so the
 * same entry point runs under `@effect/vitest` on Node and inside workerd (storage-cloudflare's
 * in-workerd runner). It must run under a TestClock (Tier 1 drives lease expiry through
 * virtual time), and requires only `Crypto.Crypto` from the environment.
