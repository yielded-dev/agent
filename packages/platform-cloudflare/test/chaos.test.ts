/**
 * No important in-memory state (exit gate; plan §3): a run whose Durable Object is aborted
 * between EVERY pair of host operations produces the same normalized canonical evidence as
 * an unchaosed control run — everything that matters was in storage. Plus the startup-
 * reconciliation ordering gate: an armed repair executes BEFORE the pass claims new work.
 *
 * The P7 WP4 seeded variant below randomizes the abort/alarm interleaving ACROSS two lanes
 * from one root seed (`CHAOS_SEED` env override; the failure output prints it), so the
 * alarm-delivery ORDER between lanes is itself chaosed while every round stays bounded.
