/**
 * The WP5 Miniflare restart lane (plan §3, §6): the eviction gate's STRONGEST form — a FULL
 * runtime restart over persisted Durable Object storage, the true "runtime restart" analogue
 * of the DN reopen tests. A representative armed-failpoint subset strands one Travel Planner
 * Submission in runtime 1 (each armed location keeps firing, so runtime 1 provably cannot
 * finish the work); a FRESH Miniflare over the SAME persist directory then converges it.
 *
 * Honest no-incoming-request evidence, per the WP0 probe's alarm-redelivery finding (probe 4:
 * Miniflare re-delivers a persisted overdue alarm after reopen without any request): the
 * reopened worker's instrumentation proves the Object received its redelivered alarm(s) and
 * ZERO client entries of any kind before the test ever reads the outcome; the reads that
 * follow (`awaitSettlement`, `observePage`) never run a maintenance pass — recovery was
 * alarm-driven alone.
