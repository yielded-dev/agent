/**
 * Reference in-memory SubmissionLedger. It implements the full port contract — atomic idempotent
 * admission, eligible FIFO claims, producer-epoch fencing, Clock-driven ownership leases, idempotent
 * canonical settlement publication/finalization, and durable abort intent — with every transition applied
 * as one atomic `Ref.modify`, but its state does not survive the process (`non-durable`).
 *
 * Adapter-specific semantics within the port's latitude:
 *
 * - Time comes exclusively from the Effect `Clock` service, so `TestClock` drives lease expiry
 *   deterministically; no wall clock is consulted.
 * - The ownership lease is pinned to `DEFAULT_OWNERSHIP_LEASE_DURATION` (D5); durable adapters
 *   own the configuration seam.
 * - Any live lease in the Thread blocks every new claim, including the same `producerId`.
 *   Unresolved unknown work is skipped only after ownership is released or expires.
 * - Claiming advances `ready` to `running` and otherwise preserves the recorded state, so
 *   progress markers from an earlier Attempt survive a reclaim.
 * - `renewOwnership` keeps the token stable (the port allows rotation); a replayed admission
 *   reports the Submission's current state alongside the original identities.
 * - `claimJoining` walks the strictly-later queue: rows already `joining`/`joined` to the
 *   SAME host extend the claimed prefix and are skipped, and an aborted-settled row is a
 *   closed obligation that is also skipped (P7 §7(c)); any other non-`ready` row (an
 *   `admitted` gap, a non-aborted settled row, foreign-host linkage) breaks the prefix
 *   conservatively.
 * - `markJoined` verifies the token against the HOST's live ownership (the lane is
 *   host-owned), so a later host Attempt can repair a lost marker from history (DUR-016). The
 *   join marker reuses the input-applied marker: the joined input IS `input:{sid}`.
 * - `suspend` and `markUnknown` refuse after canonical settlement publication under the
 *   paired journal mutation gate.
 * - `resolveAdmission` derives its answer from the single strongly consistent store, so it
 *   never answers `Indeterminate` on its own; the test-only `resolveAdmissionFault` option
 *   injects the `Indeterminate` classification so SUB-031 callers can be conformance-tested.
 * - `recordChildSettled` and `suspend(WaitingForChild)` observe child settlement directly from
 *   the child rows (single-store latitude); no separate notification marker is stored.
