/**
 * SQLite-backed Durable Object shell hosting the WP1/WP2 adapter suites. Tests use
 * `runInDurableObject` to run the adapter Layers directly against `ctx.storage`; the class
 * itself holds NO state — important state never lives in in-memory Durable Object fields,
 * and the real Thread Object class factory is WP3's `@yielded/agent-platform-cloudflare`
 * concern.
 *
 * `portCall` is the WP2 cross-Object endpoint (plan §1.3, D-P6-3): Schema-encoded port
 * request envelopes arrive over native Durable Object JS RPC and execute against THIS
 * Object's LOCAL facets over its own private SQLite storage — never against the routed
 * decorators, so a request cannot bounce between Objects. The Object identity rule is
 * `idFromName(threadId)`: routing tests name each Object by the Thread it owns.
