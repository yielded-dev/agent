# @yielded/agent

## 0.1.0-beta.168

### Minor Changes

- [#797](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/797) [`8c05714`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8c05714de84d68961b14e5ab7a3b7d809599563f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add `BrowserUse.runJev` to drive a page with a native `DecisionModel`, and `act(actions, { observe: false })` for hosts that read the next page themselves. Cloudflare native browser actions are faster and now work through payment frames, navigations and Wrangler-bundled Workers.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: `grounding: "decision"`, `mode: "plan"`, `selectTargets`, `TargetAction`, `act_ref` and the optional `BrowserActions.latestObservation` are removed. Use `BrowserUse.make({ mode })` for a model agent or `BrowserUse.runJev` for decision-model control.

- [#768](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/768) [`8214498`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8214498e8dfffde58773837fef3aa0c1fde07e9f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Publish settlement intent atomically in the canonical log and remove the separate settlement reservation protocol. Combine eligible SQL receipt finalization with publication and exclusive-session input markers with their canonical append.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: custom durable assemblies must provide a co-owned `SettlementPublisher`; pair Memory ledger and thread layers with `Layer.provideMerge`, and use fresh thread storage or format 16.

- [#768](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/768) [`8214498`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8214498e8dfffde58773837fef3aa0c1fde07e9f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Capture canonical appends before asynchronous work so later caller mutations cannot change the persisted value or invalidate its digest. Reuse captured record JSON across hashing and SQL writes, and commit eligible readonly responses with their completed results.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: custom SQL adapters must prepare raw append requests with `prepareSqlAppend`; `RawAppendRequest` is now a typed value instead of a Schema factory, and `RawRecord` is removed.

- [#768](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/768) [`8214498`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8214498e8dfffde58773837fef3aa0c1fde07e9f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Recover unfinished tools from their committed model declarations and remove the separate preparation write and outstanding-operation index.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: a crash after declaration can leave a mutating tool outcome unknown; durable Runs require unique tool call IDs and reject responses exceeding 4,096 distinct IDs with `RunJournalError` before commit or dispatch; thread stores require fresh storage or format 16. Use runtime `explain` in place of `readOutstanding`, and `DeclaredToolCallEvidence` in custom reconcilers.

  Supply JSON tool arguments and results in history used by function-based approval hooks.

- [#768](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/768) [`8214498`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8214498e8dfffde58773837fef3aa0c1fde07e9f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Run agents through one scoped Effect owner and adapt public streams with bounded backpressure. Commit validated Turn facts directly, retaining completion-tool results before input draining and declared failure values for siblings retained during child suspension.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Provide services for the whole execution; per-pull Context changes no longer reconfigure streams. Terminal Tool events follow call-local telemetry and failure observation, and `maxRunEvents` bounds observed progress rather than headless execution. Replace `bufferLimits.maxSubagentEventsPerBatch` with `maxBufferedEvents` to bound the public stream queue.

  Custom durability hooks must implement `initialize`, `commitTurn`, and `checkpoint`, retaining exposure and parameter-rejection evidence from `RunTurnResponse` and propagating retained infrastructure failures. Return `"committed"` from `commitTurn`; return `"deferred"` only when the response explicitly permits readonly deferral, and persist that response before any call-scoped durable capability. Keep completion projections pure because recovery may reevaluate persisted results before `RunCompleted` fixes the output. Decode retained sibling failures with the Tool's failure Schema instead of expecting `{ errorTag, message }` diagnostics.

- [#768](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/768) [`8214498`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8214498e8dfffde58773837fef3aa0c1fde07e9f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Prevent recovery from reverting joined input while its host is still processing it. Recheck canonical input after acquiring recovery ownership and fence rollback against the current host.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Custom `SubmissionLedger` adapters must validate a supplied `RevertJoiningRequest.guard` atomically with rollback; requests without a guard retain their existing behavior.

- [#800](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/800) [`cd15a98`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/cd15a98fb4c7bd741ac69fcb983492df1a4b4b6e) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Remove cumulative Thread record, worker-input, peer-message, and delivery limits while preserving live capacity and per-Run bounds, and refuse batches whose expanded identities and references cannot fit a complete transfer page. **BEHAVIOR CHANGE:** Use fresh layout-21 stores and `effect-agent/thread@3` records, provide `ThreadExportSource` for `streamExport({ threadId })`, and configure compaction within retained model-context bounds.

- [#770](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/770) [`f7652ff`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/f7652ff8197999e0155d6182b13cf8f70f552be2) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add scoped native browser tools with bounded frame and shadow inspection, guarded inputs, tab and dialog controls, and explicit input receipts. Expose the same operations through ordinary tools and Code Mode with host authorization and separate preparation deadlines.

- [#768](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/768) [`8214498`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8214498e8dfffde58773837fef3aa0c1fde07e9f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Bind durable Attempts to scoped storage sessions and reduce repeated ownership and tail reads in managed Node hosts.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: provide `RunStorage` in manual runtime assemblies and provide `ThreadReader` for canonical read helpers (stock adapters include it). Managed Node hosts keep `SqlClient`, `ThreadStore`, and `SubmissionLedger` private and reject custom SQLite triggers; compose application SQL with a separate client.

Reconcile drafts by Attempt and model-call identity to committed history.

- [#803](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/803) [`fadafe5`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/fadafe50ea795d8f479723661d1b02153f881c94) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Allow generic Run storage sessions to renew ownership during canonical writes and between settlement retries while coordinating mutations with token rotation. Release the latest renewed token when a session closes.

- [#784](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/784) [`80deef0`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/80deef0af2af790c68c2fda8701b3fed77c07db9) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Reduce CPU overhead in model streaming and successful tool calls while preserving validation and operation spans.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: If your trace filters target removed private helper spans, use their enclosing operation instead; selected helpers no longer create spans or Effect call frames.

- [#823](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/823) [`b246f8a`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/b246f8aaa3a92d5f82934b1fc7a82356d1ad6664) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Coalesce immediate Cloudflare alarm wakes while processing Threads inline and promptly schedule remaining work when processing exits.

BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Update filters that use private helper span names to use the enclosing agent, model, tool, storage, or recovery operation.

- [#763](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/763) [`2f062d4`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/2f062d4ed30afa9b11fb7d24cb3508d10358f3bd) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Read finalized settlements without hydrating recovery state. Add `awaitSettlementRecord` to the durable runtime and Cloudflare client to retrieve a receipt's canonical outcome and encoded result without transferring its Thread history.

- [#768](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/768) [`8214498`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/8214498e8dfffde58773837fef3aa0c1fde07e9f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Avoid rereading unfinished submissions on canonical progress by separating progress and settlement wake hints.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Quiesce the source and export/import into fresh storage for the layout-16 cutover; import only the current record format and convert archives explicitly for future semantic changes. Keep the source on destination admission conflicts or unsupported external obligations, and re-export older archives that lack batch identities. Decode custom exports through `ThreadExportRecord` to retain their wire, and pair the memory ledger and delivery store with the same `MemoryThreadStoreLive`.

- [#832](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/832) [`f38cc1a`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/f38cc1a8582515341b6e255d6b509331b0059a21) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Reduce memory retained by durable Runs after projecting their initial conversation history.

- [#798](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/798) [`bdaaf49`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/bdaaf49643e8bfd3a4a72e7bfc7cacc640993486) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Discover unfinished Thread work through `@yielded/agent/thread-work`, recover bounded pages, and explicitly rebuild disposable indexes. **BEHAVIOR CHANGE:** follow `runRecovery().cursor` to finish a scan and use fresh layout-21 stores; factual effect closure remains available after execution decisions and Run settlement and must agree with any committed tool result.

- [#835](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/pull/835) [`a1fda46`](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/commit/a1fda46d689a278beaf60fbbcfe4a19048005ced) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Avoid duplicating durable journal metadata while preparing conversation history.

Require `effect-cf@^0.53.0` for the Cloudflare adapter.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: upgrade Effect and matching provider, platform, SQL, and Atom packages to 4.0.0; replace `effect/unstable/*` imports with `effect/*` and use `effect/http-api` for HTTP APIs. Cloudflare logical alarms now back off from one second and park for hourly recovery after eight attempts without reported source progress.

### Patch Changes

- [#731](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/731) [`9a0b5bf`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/9a0b5bf0f8f7a862f805b889a7305664e82ccaf5) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Reuse eligible compacted Thread context across fresh durable Runs, refreshing it from new canonical records while preserving full replay for incompatible histories. Validate stored checkpoints through indexed canonical batch lookups.

- [#733](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/733) [`8c25dfd`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/8c25dfdd2a16271df44bdfae4258b0d5c7114c38) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Coalesce Cloudflare maintenance scheduling writes within each transaction and reuse its queue view without changing retry, publication, or recovery behavior.

## 0.1.0-beta.159

### Minor Changes

- [#719](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/719) [`976f337`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/976f3371a63b7a9f1a92b26f88371350042735b3) Thanks [@Makisuo](https://github.com/Makisuo)! - Add `AgentPolicy.modelRetries` to retry transient model failures before content streams, honoring provider retry delays and requiring readonly hosted tools.

### Patch Changes

- [#726](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/726) [`4e78cc4`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/4e78cc4c0011b9d60146397fa6e0143c70b8c9ca) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Avoid an extra history traversal when starting a durable Attempt on a compacted Thread while preserving canonical compaction and unresolved-tool validation.

- [#725](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/725) [`04889a9`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/04889a95338a4f786bdd7fdf45f23236e4dbb1ef) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Consolidate runtime guidance and clarify tool argument failures, resource cleanup, and deployment continuity.

- [#723](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/723) [`b6d171d`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/b6d171de3d385960a062ce7f8e3415ffe22bbb93) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Define the runtime's turn, ownership, recovery, and Cloudflare wake rules in one authoritative guide. Clarify joined-input restarts, notification settlement, and platform-specific limits.

- [#724](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/724) [`8a839e6`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/8a839e685444bff89ba236e0de316adf40ee010f) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Remove obsolete runtime aliases, frozen context tools, and unused storage failpoint controls. Use indexed canonical reads for selected Thread records instead of decoding a cached full history.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Use `Subagent.make`, `ContextTools.toolkit` with `ContextTools.layer`, and the registered `runResolvedWorker` in place of `Subagent.define`, legacy context tools, and `runWorker`; classify delegation with `DelegationTool` metadata instead of name helpers. Replace the removed `DoStorageFailpointTestControl` and SQLite testing module with the corresponding storage failpoint service Layers.

## 0.1.0-beta.158

### Patch Changes

- [#720](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/720) [`9a7d358`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/9a7d3581930b1a36fed318d13c966ff8efc4baa5) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Park accepted message deliveries without status polling and acknowledge native sources on terminal settlement. Bound no-progress Cloudflare maintenance and reuse canonical hydration codecs and a bounded multi-page cache.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: generic host envelopes need an exact terminal `Complete` acknowledgement or explicit receipt recovery. Draining a host lane resets its scheduling budget; eight unchanged self-rearming passes park pending work for hourly recovery and report once through the installed error reporter. New source-transaction `recordProgress` or a strictly increasing retained commit cursor resumes it immediately. Canonical hydration retention is bounded by one shared eight-MiB serialized-byte budget per isolate.

- [#721](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/721) [`a52c77f`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/a52c77fe67ac7f729f3ea1c637474f4b8036b2dd) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Prevent sequential SQLite history runs from stalling during scheduler yields while preserving run duration limits.

Keep the existing nested `WebSearch.layer` available for separately selected search models.

### Patch Changes

- [#715](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/715) [`b6ec526`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/b6ec526daf05a71d318fec0b31c5b31db54fed35) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Publish committed Run and Subagent start progress while native execution continues.

Supply application-owned browser actions through `effect-agent/browser-use` or the `BrowserUse` namespace.

## 0.1.0-beta.153

### Patch Changes

- [#702](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/702) [`4e16d81`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/4e16d81311ad26f1666fdedd23bb409f2100a669) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Enable `policy.restartOnJoinedInput` to replace a disposable model call with joined input, at most twice per run, while preserving durable usage and settlement. When enabling it, handle `ModelRestarted` by clearing drafts for its `turnId`; calls exposing provider-defined tools retain seam steering.

- [#705](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/705) [`6f9e913`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/6f9e91364cd03174bb8cf0223d0e7b468c3d7c1e) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Park unavailable or ambiguous agent bindings without repeated alarm retries or error reports. Reconsider retained submissions on the next invocation after the registered identities or definition digests change.

  Allow explicit current binding selection from the canonical submission for shared stable agent identities, preserving existing admission digests and receipts during execution and recovery. Exact-definition admission remains unambiguous.

- [#706](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/706) [`8085bda`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/8085bda3355ef97bc3f7ed82612a105581648440) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Keep Cloudflare thread and submission state in bounded write-through memory, reuse decoded journal projections, and serve warm recovery snapshots without SQLite reads. Quiesce port operations during direct SQL maintenance and call `DoThreadStore.invalidate(ctx.storage)` before resuming them; adapter writes maintain the cache automatically, and stored data needs no reset.

## 0.1.0-beta.152

### Patch Changes

- [#700](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/700) [`cff65f6`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/cff65f61b7b46fb00ebecd1a6242c1d04cf0bd24) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Resume settled discovery selections after a selected tool is removed, preserving surviving selections and the original receipts.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Upgrade the framework and Cloudflare packages together; custom routed hosts must install `routedWorkerAdmissionLayer` and provide `WakeScheduler` and `DurableRuntimeFailpoint` to owner-side port handlers under their maintenance gate. Existing records and retry receipts require no reset.

Keep retries and changed source tails subject to fresh authorization.

## 0.1.0-beta.146

### Minor Changes

- [#681](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/681) [`9252c1a`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/9252c1ad4707035308ff72527ed303a685027a28) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Publish retained lifecycle facts asynchronously in ordered owner batches without delaying model attempts, with atomic receipts and bounded retries that park exhausted work.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Implement `LifecyclePublicationHandler.publish(batch)` for a nonempty array of at most eight facts and commit the entire batch idempotently in one host transaction; custom lifecycle storage implementations must return bounded owner batches, replace `defer` with `claim`, and implement `retryParked` instead of `pendingDeadlineFor`.

### Patch Changes

- [#572](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/572) [`d1313aa`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/d1313aaf2a1be18b34e5ebfa680ed12f4cef31bc) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Remove custom worker-report APIs and registration mappers. **BEHAVIOR CHANGE:** replace `Subagent.reporting` / `reportingToWorker` with `reportToParent: true` and map typed reports on receipt; drain unprepared custom-report work with its original release before upgrading.

### Patch Changes

- [#568](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/568) [`1c33f81`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/1c33f812e4339f1b5757d2721aa8318c8119aa51) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add durable worker-wide stop and indexed summaries with exact accepted and applied input identities. Replay retained starts before public input preparation and drain up to 32 accepted worker inputs at each safe steering boundary.

- [#571](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/571) [`432036c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/432036cedbe59e8ecbdcd4c71417b730d5b781df) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add opt-in terminal worker assignments that remain steerable while waiting and permanently reject new work after completion, failure, or cancellation. Preserve existing reusable workers and upgrade native storage seals without resetting retained data.

### Patch Changes

- [#556](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/556) [`ab5030d`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/ab5030d9814a5c47f6facfdf89fe5799bdba6b00) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Isolate Thread recovery faults with history-independent status and bounded retries, let Cloudflare dispatch fresh Threads while old cleanup is pending, and keep Node startup closed on blocked recovery. Preserve content-free storage diagnostics.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Call `runtime.runRecovery()` instead of yielding `runtime.runRecovery`; its result contains ordinary Submission `reports` and one `blocked` fault per failed Thread. Blocked Threads remain ineligible for claims; pass `{ threadId }` to recover only a selected Thread.

  `SubmissionLedger.scanNonterminal` now emits control-only `SubmissionWorkItem` entries. Use `lookup` or `loadRecoverySnapshot` for selected execution payloads.

- [#558](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/558) [`6716f8c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/6716f8c5915fee466c89d9d82159fd8f2b67ece4) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Require Effect rc.116 and replace the local decision and TypeSafe APIs with native `Decision`, `DecisionModel`, and `@effect/ai-typesafe`, retaining `AutoModel` for thread selection.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Import decisions from `effect/unstable/ai` and configure TypeSafe with `TypeSafeClient.layerConfig()`; AutoModel requires at least two profiles, writes version 2 selection records, and rejects version 1 records without reselection or mutation. Retain the previous runtime for active version 1 threads or explicitly upgrade their records in your storage adapter; native probability sums must be within `1e-6` of 1.

## 0.1.0-beta.111

### Patch Changes

- [#554](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/554) [`b2cf08c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/b2cf08c14d3c455990724fb30062bdd5544dcabb) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Preserve browser dispatch evidence and add exact-page checkpoint recovery with pending-input fences. Expose structured page observations and refuse stale click/fill targets before dispatch.

## 0.1.0-beta.110

### Patch Changes

- [#551](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/551) [`c2ae9e7`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/c2ae9e777766fba0e14e8a472bc833d2122c2b10) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Acknowledge native `emit_update` success with `{ emitted: true }` after the Run accepts the update. Represent `Schema.Void` success encodings as JSON `null` in model history and programmatic broker results.

- [#549](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/549) [`a1957c4`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/a1957c457777e7f8eeb7b51ab8833f41593c3ecf) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Return retained worker delivery states with stable message references and inspect the same operation through destination acceptance and settlement.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Read `Subagent.start(...).delivery` and the `MessageStatus` returned by `followUp`; inspect their `message` instead of resending pending input, and use an accepted `receipt` for execution results, waiting, or cancellation.

- [#548](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/548) [`2582969`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/25829699c09a4cc862b650e4e30e5edc0fbb4fc0) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Keep standard worker progress and completion independent of parent runtime reads, with live
  permission checks at destination admission. Distinguish tool calls that never reached required
  durable preparation from genuinely uncertain outcomes in historical model context.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Retire pre-production standard-report worker families lacking the captured
  return address before upgrading: their execution journals, native admissions, and queued
  deliveries. Reconcile uncertain external operations before retiring receipts; source resource
  data is outside this reset scope.

## 0.1.0-beta.109

### Patch Changes

- [#545](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/545) [`cdbe786`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/cdbe786861e9ba10ecb1dccf3b26f47170a8245e) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Exclude native model-call parameter rejections from the tool failure observer while retaining failed tool results and warning telemetry. Continue reporting failures returned by started handlers.

## 0.1.0-beta.108

### Minor Changes

- [#539](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/539) [`92bd9e2`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/92bd9e26c181c07f84371a372d8885cd4db4667a) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Provide AutoModel as a native Effect model Layer to select through DecisionModel automatically on each parent or subagent thread's first turn. Retain selections across follow-ups through a shared SelectionStore, with an in-memory Layer and schema-backed records for host-owned persistence.

## 0.1.0-beta.107

### Patch Changes

- [#540](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/540) [`cfb6e1e`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/cfb6e1e04b9e80d276f918f29c369cddec5b917c) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add bounded byte-backed file selection to interactive browsers, including Cloudflare Browser Run file inputs and dynamic choosers. Distinguish confirmed selection from website upload or submission receipts.

## 0.1.0-beta.106

### Patch Changes

- [#533](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/533) [`992d062`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/992d062a095995bd8f328a01cc784b6a9a7ffc72) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Distinguish authorization check failures from policy denials and preserve original local causes with structured private diagnostics across durable settlements, Worker admissions, retained message deliveries, and programmatic Worker observation. Add reusable diagnostic codecs and bounded diagnostic context copies while keeping generated tool results and completion reports free of private causal detail.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Project Worker and validation errors into a safe failure schema before exposing them through custom tools with `failureMode: "return"`; their new causal fields are private diagnostics.

- [#530](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/530) [`caf7e7e`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/caf7e7ea69448fb820f9e95cffe480cbb458d500) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Preserve each invocation's tracing context and sampling decision when running registered attempts or preparing reports. Remove per-poll, digest, and response-part helper spans while retaining operation boundaries and errors, and allow hosts to use effect-cf 0.45.

## 0.1.0-beta.103

## 0.1.0-beta.102

- [#521](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/521) [`be0dcaf`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/be0dcafb69e0641d8b82ff174fee53a53e367f18) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Settle cancelled durable runs as aborted when tool authorization observes their abort intent before the cancellation watcher.

## 0.1.0-beta.101

### Patch Changes

- [#517](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/517) [`6a4f4f8`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/6a4f4f870fe87ebb0d3cc76905dcadd77c9a29ef) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Expose bounded outstanding-operation and pending-delivery reads, exact canonical record locators, and native worker/peer admission lookups. Retain uncertain external outcomes after abort and retire worker inputs only after their effects are resolved.

## 0.1.0-beta.100

## 0.1.0-beta.99

### Patch Changes

- [#513](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/513) [`e1f06bb`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/e1f06bbd3f66478c9223c5888696cd8c6e75fc37) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Preserve registered tool replay contracts when an attempt copies its Agent Definition to restore accepted execution limits. Keep interrupted idempotent operations recoverable without repeating their committed durable steps.

## 0.1.0-beta.98

### Patch Changes

- [#507](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/507) [`95c962f`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/95c962f8ee45c35f877d0bb21f82d4f6bac6759c) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Continue accepted requests with current Agent bindings, retaining original operations and outcomes while allowing later input around unknown work under one Thread lease. BEHAVIOR CHANGE: replace historical binding manifests with per-operation replay versions and deploy matching runtime and storage packages together.

## 0.1.0-beta.97

### Patch Changes

- [#504](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/504) [`385f119`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/385f1197eb41e8114c5daf5b6763824450095cf5) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Resume retained requests across compatible input changes and widened JSON Schema object declarations using their original payloads and receipts. Keep changed semantics and incompatible operations pending until compatible code is available.

## 0.1.0-beta.96

### Minor Changes

- [#490](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/490) [`771498b`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/771498b1952794b8f2f19d1e35b604937bffcc3c) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Resume retained requests using explicit replay contracts and back off failed and blocked Cloudflare maintenance without abandoning child obligations or changing receipts. BEHAVIOR CHANGE: bound durable execution duration per active Attempt, retain actual duration exhaustion, and deploy matching runtime and storage packages before writing the new record.

## 0.1.0-beta.95

## 0.1.0-beta.94

### Patch Changes

- [#494](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/494) [`373d188`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/373d18828f2fc2851614cf2612c5e71e91075c88) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Return invalid native tool arguments to the model when the tool uses `failureMode: "return"`, before approval or handler execution. Preserve rejection evidence through durable recovery and allow corrected Code Mode arguments in the same run.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Custom durability hooks must persist `RunTurnResponseCommit.toolParameterRejections` and restore it through `RunTurnResume.toolParameterRejections`.

- [#497](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/497) [`bbb709c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/bbb709c9beff0b8f2e6b67d05e0f8223a7cb6f93) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Return complete tool discovery matches within the configured UTF-8 byte budget, with an actionable notice when documentation is omitted. Keep agent runs able to continue when no match fits, using an empty tool selection instead of a limit-exceeded failure.

## 0.1.0-beta.93

### Patch Changes

- [#491](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/491) [`319c156`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/319c156be5a85a2d490cf79531f94591881436f8) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Rename the in-memory runtime setup to `InMemory.layer` and clarify that conversations can span Runs for the lifetime of the application Scope.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace the `Ephemeral` root import with `InMemory` and the `effect-agent/ephemeral` module path with `effect-agent/in-memory`.

## 0.1.0-beta.92

### Patch Changes

- [#487](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/487) [`054b1c3`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/054b1c3a7e7a6571fc82caedc4ae8835c5aacfb4) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Require Effect rc.115 across the packages and effect-cf 0.43.0 for Cloudflare hosts.

## 0.1.0-beta.91

### Patch Changes

- [#485](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/485) [`b60b07e`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/b60b07e307dc366637f5247fb788b24b17c554eb) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Reduce CPU work for large SQL memory writes and receipt replay while preserving storage limits and receipt validation.

## 0.1.0-beta.90

## 0.1.0-beta.89

### Minor Changes

- [#479](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/479) [`983a558`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/983a558703a187285ff9c900792defc8f15984a1) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Add host-owned protected browser suspension, exact-page resume, and authorized human takeover while preserving credential exposure and browser budgets. Require fresh observation after Return and keep transferred sessions independent of the previous Attempt’s scope.

## 0.1.0-beta.88

### Patch Changes

- [#476](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/476) [`5e24e87`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/5e24e8782203aef836c8b4ba49e72468d7d510b1) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Label agent and model spans with GenAI operation names and agent, conversation, and model identity for agent dashboards. Update span-name filters from `AgentRuntime.run` to `invoke_agent <agent ID>` and from `LanguageModel.streamText` to `chat <model>`.

## 0.1.0-beta.87

### Patch Changes

- [#471](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/471) [`0be6edf`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/0be6edfa8c73822f59184e6177a265c56c3ac1cd) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Persist completed Tool results before draining new inputs. An admission read failure after a Tool returns no longer loses its outcome, turns it into an unknown call, or blocks later submissions behind it. Preserve atomic no-tool and completion-Tool terminal commits.

## 0.1.0-beta.86

### Minor Changes

- [#466](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/466) [`6560df2`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/6560df20d900627d28d745ea11e9759774bb9cf0) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Consolidate agent definitions, execution, capabilities, and sandbox contracts into `effect-agent`, and use kebab-case public module paths across framework packages.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace `@effect-agent/core`, `@effect-agent/engine`, `@effect-agent/capabilities`, and `@effect-agent/sandbox` dependencies with `effect-agent`; migrate direct imports such as `effect-agent/AgentRuntime` to `effect-agent/agent-runtime` and upgrade framework packages together.

- [#466](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/466) [`6560df2`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/6560df20d900627d28d745ea11e9759774bb9cf0) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Fold `@effect-agent/thread` into `effect-agent` and expose the in-memory conversation model through the `Thread` namespace. Keep database drivers and platform hosts in their adapter packages.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace `@effect-agent/thread/*` imports with `effect-agent/*` and remove the old dependency. Use `Thread.Store`, `Thread.Thread`, `Thread.layerMemory`, and `Thread.toPrompt` in place of the `EphemeralThreads` module; import `PersistentHistory` from the package root for `PersistentHistory.layer`. Stored formats and service identities are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#467](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/467) [`1112b1b`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/1112b1bfb388be600c9326737d10608660698ef3) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Reduce the time required to certify durable adapters and run subscription-store conformance.

- [#466](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/466) [`6560df2`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/6560df20d900627d28d745ea11e9759774bb9cf0) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Run agents and attached subagents with `Ephemeral.layer` for in-memory conversation history, default IDs, and module-level `Subagent.layer` and `ThreadHistory.layer` APIs.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace `SubagentRuntime.layer` with `Subagent.layer`.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Remove `IdGenerator` from service requirement unions and omit routine ID Layer provisions; custom generator overrides still work, and explicitly selecting the default uses the module-level `layer` export from `effect-agent/id-generator`.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace `ThreadHistory.layerTransient` with `ThreadHistory.layer`; share one application Layer and reuse Thread IDs to retain conversations between Runs. Complete history updates remain after a failed or interrupted Run and are released when the application Scope closes. Custom history adapters must declare `retention` as `"incremental"` or `"on-success"` and return a history owner from `open`.

## 0.1.0-beta.85

### Minor Changes

- [#459](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/459) [`eab5b7c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/eab5b7c0ea2c52bf81e947253a8387a4b1e78c9d) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Opt into durable typed parent completion messages with `Subagent.background(Research, { start: true, followUp: true, reportToParent: true })`, without an application input union, mapper, or reporting registration. Pass a custom reporting descriptor as `reportToParent` when an application-specific input format is needed.

- [#459](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/459) [`eab5b7c`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/eab5b7c0ea2c52bf81e947253a8387a4b1e78c9d) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Accept Agent definitions directly in background subagent tools and declare typed intermediate updates on Agents. Deliver opted-in worker findings to the parent before completion, with durable retention, ordering, and bounded backpressure.

  BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Rename Conversation identifiers, fields, record families and tags, and the durable-admin `--conversation` selector to their Thread equivalents. Reset incompatible alpha storage before upgrading.

### Patch Changes

- [#256](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/pull/256) [`ac70e21`](https://github.com/danieljvdm/effect-agent/commit/ac70e212c7d9741ce48bd9b2a4dbd355f9dac72e) Thanks [@danieljvdm](https://github.com/danieljvdm)! - Declare `effect` as a required `^4.0.0-rc.111` peer across all public packages so they share the application's runtime and accept compatible upgrades. Keep `effect` in application dependencies at a version satisfying the framework's and providers' peer ranges.

  model-declared and programmatic broker calls, value-level failures, and delayed terminal event/
  trace commit, while isolating complete span-lifecycle defects through Effect's error reporter.
  Build Cloudflare Conversation Objects on `effect-cf`'s native `DurableObject.make` boundary so it
  owns the cached runtime, event-scoped Layers, native RPC methods, `waitUntil`, and post-RPC OTLP
  flush isolation. Upgrade to `effect-cf` 0.25.3 so the same upstream boundary flushes alarm
  telemetry. Remove Effect Agent's duplicate telemetry service, flush coordinator, timeout
  configuration, and lifecycle fixture matrix.

  surface — schema-first authoring (core), the bounded interpreter (engine),
  and operational capabilities — as one dependency-clean root package,
  mirroring how `effect` fronts the `@effect/*` satellites. Platform adapters
