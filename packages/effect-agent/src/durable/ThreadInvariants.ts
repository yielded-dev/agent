 * Input of one invariant verification, assembled entirely from port reads (or from a captured

 *
 * - `export` — the Thread's canonical export (`ThreadStore.export`).
 * - `submissions` — every known Submission row of the lane (ledger scan + lookups). Order is
 *   irrelevant; the checker sorts by `queueSequence`.
 * - `batchProducers` — optional producer identity directory for older exports lacking `batches`.
 *   Current exports carry the directory and preserve the validated original record wire,
 *   including additive fields unknown to this reader. Without either directory, `digest-chain`
 *   and `checkpoint-binding` report `skipped`; adapter-level `verifyOnOpen` still audits storage.
 * - `checkpoint` — the stored checkpoint to bind against the recomputed chain, when one exists.
 * - `checkpointsSupported` — whether the caller inspected a supporting adapter. Without this
 *   evidence or a supplied checkpoint, checkpoint verification is skipped.
 * - `requireAllSettled` — convergence mode (certification Tier 2, chaos, soak): additionally
 *   require every known Submission to be settled.

 * 1. `schema-round-trip` — every envelope re-encodes and re-decodes through its canonical
 *    Schema (a corrupted copy fails typed instead of decoding incorrectly).
 * 2. `record-identity` — no canonical record identity appears twice (DUR-007 dedupe held).
 * 3. `sequence-contiguity` — gap-free sequences from 1 through the exported tail.
 * 4. `digest-chain` — the tail digest recomputes from `EMPTY_TAIL_DIGEST` through every batch
 *    (requires the per-batch producer directory; skipped honestly otherwise).
 * 5. `fifo-input-order` / `fifo-settlement-order` — canonical input and settlement records
 *    follow the admitted queue order (DUR-004), except a later input may settle before a Run
 *    with canonically unresolved unknown calls when that input became active. Resolving those
 *    calls later does not revoke the later Run's ownership. Aborted settlements of never-run work (no
 *    canonical `input:{sid}` record) are exempt from the settlement comparison: P7 §7(c)
 *    settles them immediately without waiting for the head, and DUR-004 bounds execution
 *    order, which never-run work has none of.
 * 6. `terminal-uniqueness` — at most one canonical terminal record per Submission, exactly one
 *    for every settled ledger row (DUR-002).
 * 7. `ledger-canonical-agreement` — a settled ledger row has a canonical settlement record and
 *    the outcomes agree; canonical history remains the authority (DUR-015).
 * 8. `checkpoint-binding` — a stored checkpoint's digest matches the recomputed chain at its
 *    sequence (needs the chain; bounds are checked regardless).
 * 9. `all-settled` — convergence mode only: every known Submission settled.
 *
 * Requires only `Crypto.Crypto` (digest recomputation); it performs no port access, so the
 * admin operation, certification runners, and chaos properties feed it whatever copies they
 * hold.
