/**
 * Pure recovery classifier (durability §14, DUR-013): a finite persisted snapshot plus canonical
 * evidence deterministically selects exactly one decision. Precedence, most-settled first
 * (plan §4.2/§4.3 — note the deliberate P5 reorder: canonical settlement beats
 * open tool calls, because a recorded terminal outcome is never revisited, DUR-002/DUR-015; and
 * the three S2 edits: the abort row propagates to nonterminal attached children, delegation
 * calls never mark Unknown, and the suspended row branches on the suspension reason):
 *
 * 1. `settled` → NoAction — terminal outcomes are never revisited (DUR-002).
 * 2. canonical settlement record → FinalizeLedgerFromHistory — history beats every ledger
 *    marker (DUR-015), including stale open tool calls.
 * 3. joined-side states (DUR-016): `joining` without canonical input → RevertJoining; `joining`
 *    with canonical input → RepairJoinMarker (marker lost); `joined` + host settled →
 *    SettleJoinedWithHost; `joined` + host live → AwaitHostSettlement (deferred).
 * 4. abort intent → the S2 abort rows (spec §13.1 request-abort-and-join): an unproven child
 *    admission waits, an admitted-but-unlinked child repairs its start link, a nonterminal
 *    attached child gets PropagateChildAbort — the parent does NOT settle — terminal children
 *    are joined, incomplete releases applied, provably childless reservations released; ONLY a
 *    parent with no open child obligation reaches SettleAborted, where open ordinary calls
 *    become `ToolCallUnknown` audit records, never a rollback claim (§13). SettleAborted is
 *    position-blind by design (P7 §7(c)): an aborted, never-claimed `ready` Submission earns it
 *    ANYWHERE in the queue — the executor settles it immediately without waiting for it to head
 *    the lane, because settlement order of never-run work is not execution order (DUR-004
 *    bounds execution order; DUR-012 permits settling inactive accepted work without an
 *    Attempt).
 * 5. ordinary open tool calls (state not yet `unknown`) → MarkUnknown — reconcile-then-mark,
 *    never an automatic replay (DUR-009). Delegation calls are EXCLUDED (plan §4.3's most
 *    important edit): their declared-without-outcome state is provably replay-safe and routes
 *    through rows 4/7/8 instead. A lane already `unknown` is in the DUR-017 resolution regime
 *    (row 6) and is not re-marked.
 * 6. state `unknown` → ApplyUnknownResolutions when durable intents cover every open ordinary
 *    call, else AwaitUnknownResolution.
 * 7. state `suspended` branches on the stored reason: `WaitingForChild` → ResumeWaitingParent
 *    when every listed child is provably settled (replay the idempotent wake), else
 *    AwaitChildSettlement (SUB-030); `ApprovalPending` keeps the P5 behavior — undecided
 *    canonical approval requests → AwaitApprovalDecision (repairing a lost suspend transition
 *    from history), or ResumeSuspended when approval preflight can proceed. A retained denial
 *    ends preflight without waiting for later declarations.
 * 8. the S2 establishment/join rows for a live parent (spec §13, most-repairing first):
 *    ApplyJoinAccounting → CompleteChildAdmission → RepairSubagentStartLink →
 *    AwaitChildAdmissionResolution → ResumePendingToolBatch (idempotent handler re-entry) →
 *    EnsureWaitingForChild → ResumeWaitingParent → ReleaseOrphanChildReservation.
 * 9. unfinished declared tool batch → ResumePendingToolBatch — the worker checks original
 *     operation contracts after uncertain effects have been reconciled or blocked (§15).
 * 10. `admitted` → a parent-linked Submission whose Thread lacks the canonical lineage
 *     record defers (AwaitParentEstablishment: the parent's idempotent establishment
 *     completes it); otherwise
 *     CompleteMaterialization / RepairReadiness by Thread durability.
 * 11. otherwise → ApplyInput / RepairInputMarker / ResumeFromTurnBoundary by canonical input
 *     evidence, with the ledger marker repaired from history, never the reverse.
 *
 * A CHILD Submission (one whose snapshot carries `parentLinkage`) classifies through exactly
 * the same rows as any Submission — child recovery proceeds under its own ownership token and
 * epoch (spec §13, SUB-020); nothing here consults the parent's lane.
 *
 * Ownership leases are deliberately ignored here: the executor's fenced claim is the only
 * authority over liveness, and a stale Attempt is fenced by producer epoch regardless (DUR-006).
