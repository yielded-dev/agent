 * may skip settlement registrations, whose readers only need finalized submissions. Adapters
 * may conservatively ignore the optional modes; decorators should forward them to retain filtering.
 *
 * Correctness must NEVER depend on delivery: notifications may be dropped, coalesced, duplicated,
 * or observed by no subscriber (a notify before any subscription is simply lost). Every consumer
 * must pair a wake with durable authority: workers use periodic SubmissionLedger scans, while a
 * public progress waiter subscribes before its canonical read and reconnects/rechecks after an
 * incarnation loss (persistence §14).
 *
 * Each run of `wakes` creates its own subscription whose resources live in that run's Scope and
 * are released when the consuming stream ends or is interrupted. Implementations must not spawn
 * daemon fibers.
