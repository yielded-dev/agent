/**
 * Coordinator-owned failpoint locations (plan §Failpoints). Locations normally sit immediately
 * AFTER one durable mutation of the six-step coordinator flow, so a fault injected there
 * simulates a crash between two durable steps; the matching BEFORE boundary of each mutation is
 * owned by the storage adapters (`ledger:*:before`, `append:before`, ...), giving every durable
 * mutation a failpoint on both sides (change discipline). Run-start append also exposes its
 * BEFORE boundary here to distinguish a fresh clock from a committed clock in crash tests.
 *
 * The `subagent:*` family covers every durable mutation of the S2 establishment/join protocol
 * including reservation, request append, child admission, child readiness,
 * start-link append, sibling per-call settles at the suspension seam, the `waitingForChild`
 * suspension, child abort propagation, the atomic join batch, and both reservation-release
 * transitions.
