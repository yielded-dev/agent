`@yielded/agent-platform-node` stores thread history and pending work in SQLite.
A bounded worker pool executes registered agents and recovers work after a restart.

## Install

```sh
bun add @yielded/agent-platform-node@beta effect
```

Keep framework packages at one release and use compatible [Effect and provider packages](/guide/getting-started/#installation-and-compatibility).

## Create an agent

Save this as `node-agent.ts`. The model's client reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment.
The version declarations identify the agent, model, and tools used by accepted work.

```ts twoslash title="node-agent.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/node-agent.ts"

```

## Start the host

Use a persistent database path with one live host per SQLite file. Give each replacement host
incarnation a distinct `producerId`.
The automatic host holds SQLite's exclusive connection lock for its entire Scope. Another host
fails startup, and independent readers cannot access the database while that connection is alive.
Use a local filesystem with working SQLite locks; do not replace or unlink a live database file.
New files are initialized in WAL mode; existing files must already use WAL mode.
`workerConcurrency` limits concurrently processed threads and defaults to one.
The managed host dispatches wake hints through one bounded queue, coalescing repeated hints
for pending or active threads. A shared periodic ledger scan recovers missed hints.
The scan stops when the last subscriber leaves and restarts when another subscribes.
`NodeDurableHost.layer` checks storage, recovers pending work, and starts the worker pool when
the Layer is acquired. Save this as `node-host.ts`, replacing `producerId` for each process start:

```ts twoslash title="node-host.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/node-host.ts"

```

TypeScript infers the registration's model, tool, instruction, and schema service requirements.
Provide those services to the Layer, as `OpenAiLive` does here. Node supplies Crypto.

Save this as `node-main.ts` and run it with Node's TypeScript transform support:

```ts twoslash title="node-main.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/node-main.ts"

```

```sh
node --experimental-transform-types node-main.ts
```

`NodeDurableHost.run` observes the existing pool; calling it again does not start more workers.
If a worker fails, admission closes and `run` fails with the original typed error or defect.
`NodeRuntime.runMain` then closes the host. Use `run` rather than `Layer.launch(HostLive)`,
which does not observe background worker failures. Interrupting only an observer leaves the
pool running; closing the host's Scope closes admission, stops and joins workers, releases
ownership, and closes storage and application services.

If the process also serves requests, race the server Effect with `NodeDurableHost.run` using
`Effect.raceFirst`, and provide the shared `HostLive` to that combined Effect. A worker failure
then stops the server too. Creating two separate host Layers for the same SQLite file is unsupported.

## Use an Effect Workflow engine

To drive the durable runtime through an injected `WorkflowEngine`, follow the
[Effect Workflows guide](/guide/workflows/). Its [Node.js setup](/guide/workflows/#node)
uses SQLite and a single-process Cluster runner.

## Custom runtime composition

Use `NodeDurableAgentRuntime.layerRegistered` when you own execution, as in the
[Workflow assembly](/guide/workflows/#node). It captures registrations and acquires storage without starting workers.
`layerWithBindings` accepts precompiled `ResolvedBinding` values whose application Scope you own;
`layer` constructs an unregistered runtime for explicit admission and execution.

The service class's existing `NodeDurableHost.layerRegistered`, `layerStack`, and `layer`
constructors remain available for manually managed hosts. Import the class from
`@yielded/agent-platform-node/node-durable-host` when using these APIs; their workers start only
when you run `host.runResolvedWorkers`. The module-level `NodeDurableHost.layer` shown above
owns worker startup and is the default for an application.

These manual assemblies retain lease-based recovery and do not acquire the automatic host's
exclusive authority or retire claims on startup. They remain suitable for explicit runtime
composition; a producer name alone never permits reclaiming a live lease.

Registrations carry application version declarations. Update them when behavior changes,
including tool implementations that JSON cannot represent. Register one current binding per
stable `agentId`; queued and resumed work uses that binding without requiring historical agent
or toolbox versions. Accepted inputs and prepared deliveries retain their original identities
and payloads. `digestDefinitions` computes the digests for explicit submissions;
`DurableWorkerBinding.make(agent, digests)` accepts precomputed digests.

An unresolved tool effect remains a parked Unknown Outcome with its settlement obligation intact.
Later input in the same Thread can run without replaying that effect. Approval waits and joined
input still preserve their ordering barriers, and live ownership prevents another claim. Inspect
the parked operation through `explainThread`, then use authorized resolution or abort when needed.

## Configure runtime services

Pass service layers in the options to `NodeDurableHost.layer` or `NodeDurableAgentRuntime.layer`:

| Option              | Service                 | Default                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `runContext`        | `RunContextPreparation` | No prompt transform or transient reference context |
| `toolAuthorization` | `RunToolAuthorization`  | Allow all tool calls                               |
| `toolReconciler`    | `ToolReconciler`        | Keep unconfirmed tool outcomes unknown             |

Add these options to the host assembly above. Use
`{ runContext: RunContextLive }` for [prompt preparation](/guide/context-management/),
or `{ toolAuthorization: SearchOnlyLive }` for a [tool policy](/guide/tools/#authorize-tool-calls).
Use `{ toolReconciler: SupplierReconcilerLive }` for supplier-backed recovery of unconfirmed tool
outcomes. Configure these services independently or together.

Select [native compaction](/guide/context-management/#replacing-compaction) by providing its Layer
directly to the host, for example `HostLive.pipe(Layer.provide(ContextCompactor.layerRollover))`.
Without an injected `ContextCompactor`, the host uses the default pruning and summarization strategy.

The assembled layer retains each extension's construction errors and application dependencies
in its error and requirement types. The host supplies `Crypto.Crypto`. Provide the remaining
dependencies through ordinary `Layer.provide` composition before running the application.

Let `layer` or `layerStack` infer the types from your options. When annotating reusable options,
`NodeDurableAgentRuntimeOptions<ContextError, ContextRequirements, AuthorizationError, AuthorizationRequirements, ReconcilerError, ReconcilerRequirements>`
preserves all three layers' construction contracts.

The runtime captures services when the host layer is acquired. Keep their resources alive for
its Scope. Providing replacements around a later worker call does not change the captured services.
`toolFailureObserver` configures [recovered tool failure reporting](/guide/run-agents/#observe-recovered-tool-failures).

## Submit and follow work

1. Authenticate the caller and call `host.submit(agent, input, options)`.
   Supply the thread ID, principal, idempotency key, and definition digests.
2. Return the receipt after admission.
3. Await completion with `host.awaitSettlement(receipt)`, or stream records with `host.observe(receipt)`.

Reuse the idempotency key when retrying the same request. Different input under that key fails
with an admission conflict.

## Shutdown and recovery

Closing the host's Scope stops admission, releases ownership, and closes SQLite.
After abrupt process death, including `SIGKILL`, the operating system releases the automatic
host's connection lock. Its replacement acquires that lock, checks storage compatibility, and
atomically fences and retires retained claims before ordinary recovery. It does not wait for
the old ownership lease. Startup, history validation, and provider work still take time.
Lease, renewal, and wake-scan defaults remain 30 seconds, 10 seconds, and 1 second.
Unconfirmed external tool outcomes require reconciliation or authorized resolution before replay.
Startup recovery must succeed for every Thread before admission or workers open. A retained-history
fault or recovery timeout fails host construction with `RecoveryBlocked`; accepted work stays pending.

Inspect `host.startupRecovery`, `host.explain`, `host.verify`, and `host.scanObligations`
for recovery status while the host is running. Additional adapters and administrative SQL must
share the host's exposed `SqlClient`; do not open a second connection. Stop the host before using
the standalone `admin:durable` CLI or another database reader. See [operations](/guide/operations/)
for approvals, schedules, and backups.
