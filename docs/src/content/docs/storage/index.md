<a id="storage"></a>

Storage adapters provide Effect services for thread history and accepted work.
Choose where that state lives, then connect the stores to your agent runtime.

| [In-memory](/storage/memory/)      | Conversations within one application Scope; isolated stores for tests |
| [SQLite](/storage/sqlite/)         | Persistent history in a local Node.js database                        |
| [PostgreSQL](/storage/postgres/)   | A database shared by multiple processes, using your Effect SQL client |
| [Cloudflare](/storage/cloudflare/) | SQLite owned by a Durable Object                                      |

Keep `@yielded/agent` and its adapters on the same release. See
[installation and compatibility](/guide/getting-started/#installation-and-compatibility)
for the matching Effect and model provider packages.

## Connect storage to execution

Use `InMemory.layer` for conversations that live with your application.
For history that survives a restart, connect a database's `ThreadStore` to
`PersistentHistory.layer` and provide it to `AgentRuntime`:

  accTitle: Persistent history storage
  accDescr: AgentRuntime uses PersistentHistory, which uses a ThreadStore backed by a database.
  runtime["AgentRuntime"] --> history["PersistentHistory"] --> store["ThreadStore"] --> database["database"]
```

The [SQLite](/storage/sqlite/) and [PostgreSQL](/storage/postgres/) guides show the complete Layer wiring.
Successful Runs are retained; interrupted execution is not resumed. Reuse a thread ID
to continue its conversation. See [Threads](/guide/threads/) for history behavior.

Durable execution also needs a `SubmissionLedger`, a `SettlementPublisher`, registered agents,
and a host that drives recovery and pending work. The publisher belongs to the same storage owner
as the journal and ledger: it checks settlement authority and appends the canonical terminal fact
atomically. `RunStorage.layer()` requires this adapter service; independently supplied stores do
not provide a non-atomic fallback. The [Node.js](/platforms/node/) and
[Cloudflare](/platforms/cloudflare/) hosts assemble those pieces with their storage.
For another host, see [custom durable runtime composition](/guide/run-agents/#assemble-a-custom-durable-runtime).
Storage alone does not start workers or recover unfinished Runs.

## Back up or change record formats

`ThreadStore.export` captures one complete, bounded Thread and its immutable admission facts.
The local `ThreadImport` service validates that archive and atomically installs it into an empty
Thread. Queued admissions keep their order, timestamps, and opaque policy facts. The destination
checks its admission constraints. Import rebuilds ledger state from canonical records; projections
and checkpoints are disposable.
No claims or leases are copied, and unresolved mutating tools retain their uncertainty.

The unreleased protocol accepts only fresh layout-19 stores and `effect-agent/thread@2` archives.
Predecessor stores fail before mutation; no older layout upgrade or archive converter is included.
See the [operator procedure and limits](/guide/operations/#adopting-these-contracts).

## Build another adapter

`@yielded/agent-storage-sql` contains shared SQL implementations for thread history,
submissions, schedules, subscriptions, message delivery, and activity progress.
SQLite and PostgreSQL use this core; Cloudflare reuses the helpers that fit Durable Objects.

An adapter supplies the database-specific initialization, transactions, and error handling
around an Effect `SqlClient`. Start with the [shared SQL package reference](/reference/packages/#effect-agent-storage-sql)
and [storage adapter contracts](/guide/certify-adapters/).
