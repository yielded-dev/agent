<a id="cloudflare"></a>

Cloudflare stores thread history and accepted work in Durable Object SQLite.
Each Object owns its database, separate from other Objects. Records survive Object
eviction and reconstruction. While the Object is live, the adapters share bounded,
write-through memory for thread headers, submissions, recovery state, and the journal tail.
Native reads reuse those committed views; cache misses reload validated rows. Canonical row
retention shares one eight-MiB serialized-byte budget across the isolate, rather than allocating
that allowance to each Object. Decoded row views are released with their retained raw rows.
Memory stores
over the same owner share its transaction gate and document, receipt, and usage views.
Failed transactions discard cached state.

Completed Runs can retain a disposable prompt checkpoint beside the canonical log. A fresh Run
after eviction verifies its log head and saved prompt digest, then projects only the latest Run's
records. Checkpoints retain at most 16 MiB of prompt JSON per Thread and replace their predecessor
after settlement. Missing or incompatible checkpoints, changed fences, interleaved work, and
compaction use canonical reconstruction. Unfinished Run recovery and explicit verification always
rebuild from canonical facts; exports do not depend on checkpoints. The live prompt itself still
grows with uncompacted conversation bytes.

## Run durable agents

Use [`@yielded/agent-platform-cloudflare`](/platforms/cloudflare/) for the complete
host. `ThreadObject.layer` and `ThreadObject.make` assemble storage, registrations,
admission, RPC, and alarm-driven recovery. The
[Cloudflare setup](/platforms/cloudflare/#create-the-thread-object) includes the
agent, provider, Object class, and binding configuration. No separate storage Layer
is needed.

## Use an existing Object

If your application already owns a SQLite Durable Object, follow
[custom host integration](/platforms/cloudflare/#share-an-application-object) to share
its database and alarm slot with the runtime. Reuse the host's Effect SQL client
for application queries.

`@yielded/agent-storage-cloudflare` also exposes `DoThreadStore` and
`DoSubmissionLedger` for custom assemblies. Their convenience Layers accept
`ctx.storage` and supply the SQL client and Crypto. Both stores must use the same
database so ownership claims fence the same records. These adapters provide storage
ports; acquiring them alone does not drive agent execution or recovery.

Use the adapters for ordinary writes. If maintenance writes private adapter tables directly,
call `DoThreadStore.invalidate(ctx.storage)` afterward, before serving port reads. Keep
port operations quiesced during both steps and enroll the write with the host's mutation gate.
This invalidates the adapters' shared views;
it does not change durable data. Canonical records remain append-only.

Background worker starts validate authority and reserve capacity at the source, then admit and
initialize the child through one destination RPC. Custom routed assemblies must install
`PortRouting.routedWorkerAdmissionLayer` alongside the routed ledger and thread store. The
owner-side port handler requires `WakeScheduler` and `DurableRuntimeFailpoint` and must run
mutations through the host's maintenance gate. `ThreadObject.make` and `ThreadObject.layerInHost`
provide this wiring, including enrollment of affected maintenance lanes. Upgrade the framework,
storage and host packages together; stored records and retry receipts need no reset.

## Optional shared memory

Thread history and memory shared across threads have different owners. For shared
documents, recall, and routed memory operations, see
[Cloudflare shared memory](/platforms/cloudflare/#shared-memory).
