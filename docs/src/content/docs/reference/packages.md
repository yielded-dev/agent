<a id="package-map"></a>

Start with `@yielded/agent@beta` for agent definitions, conversations, execution, and durability.
Install storage, platform, sandbox execution, and testing packages as needed.

Keep all framework packages at the same release. Package manifests declare the compatible
Effect and platform versions.
Before 1.0, APIs and stored data may change without a migration path.

## Public imports

Prefer named namespace imports from package roots in application code and examples.
Namespaces use PascalCase; direct module paths use kebab-case. Agent definitions, execution,
capabilities, and durability live in one package:

```ts twoslash
import { Agent, AgentRuntime } from "@yielded/agent";

Agent.make;
AgentRuntime.run;
```

The same convention applies to adapters:

```ts twoslash
import { NodeDurableHost } from "@yielded/agent-platform-node";

NodeDurableHost.layer;
```

For direct module access, unbundled startup, or lazy-loading boundaries, use:

```ts
import * as NodeDurableHost from "@yielded/agent-platform-node/node-durable-host";
import * as Agent from "@yielded/agent/agent";
import * as AgentRuntime from "@yielded/agent/agent-runtime";
```

Both forms support tree shaking in bundles. Native Node evaluates every namespace re-exported
by a root import; `sideEffects` does not make those exports lazy. Direct paths limit the initial
module graph, including when importing upstream Effect modules. Other root imports in the same
process can still load those shared modules.

Use direct module paths at lazy-loading boundaries: mixing a
static root import with a dynamic import of that same root can pull the runtime into the initial
bundle. Also use dedicated subpaths for optional adapters and helpers intended for another
runtime, such as the Node-safe Cloudflare AI Gateway helper. The Cloudflare package root
includes Workers-specific modules. Provider, storage, platform, and testing packages remain
separate installs.

`Agent.make` and `AgentRuntime.run` have the same call shape through either import form.
Use direct imports for individual declarations, including services and Schema values, instead
of importing a namespace when only its service key is needed:

```ts
import { IdGenerator } from "@yielded/agent/id-generator";
import { CommandDrainPolicy, RunSchedulingOverride } from "@yielded/agent/run-options";
```

Root imports name module namespaces. For example, root `AgentPolicy` exposes its Schema class as
`AgentPolicy.AgentPolicy`; a named import from `@yielded/agent/agent-policy` selects that class
directly. Ordinary agent definitions can pass a plain `policy` object to `Agent.make`, which
validates it and fills defaults.

Operations are available directly on their module namespace: `Subagent.layer`,
`ThreadHistory.layer`, and `IdGenerator.layer`. Service keys remain inside those modules,
for example `IdGenerator.IdGenerator` when supplying a custom generator.

### Model requirements

Provide a native Effect model with `Effect.provide(model)` around an agent Run, or
`Layer.provide(model)` around `Subagent.layer(delegation)`. The [agent guide](/guide/agents/#provide-native-model-services)
shows this default composition. [AutoModel](/reference/decision-models/#automodel) uses the same API.

For an explicit reusable pairing, `Agent.withModel(definition, model)` returns an optional Agent
Binding. `Subagent.layer(delegation, model)` also accepts an explicit model override.
Durable registration uses `{ agent: definition, model, definitions: versions }` so the host owns
each agent's model and version declarations; an existing Binding is also accepted.

### In-memory defaults

Import `InMemory` from `@yielded/agent`, or use `import * as InMemory from "@yielded/agent/in-memory"`.

`InMemory.layer` supplies in-memory conversation history and a shared subagent reservation ledger.
Provide it once around the parent program and all child handler Layers. Runs with the same Thread
ID retain their conversation for that application Scope; independent builds have independent state.
Complete history updates remain after a failed or interrupted Run. Scope closure or process loss
releases the state; this layer provides no crash recovery. See [in-memory conversations](/guide/threads/#in-memory-conversations)
for limits and a follow-up example.

Runtime IDs have an overridable default; no ID Layer is required. Context preparation is also
optional. `InMemory.layer` preserves custom IDs and context preparation supplied by the caller.
Models, tool handlers, credentials, and durable storage remain explicit application choices.

For storage-backed history, provide `PersistentHistory.layer` with a store and, when using subagents,
one shared `SubagentReservationsMemoryLive` instead of `InMemory.layer`. Durable hosts select
their own history and reservation services.

`IdGenerator` is a `Context.Reference`. Override it with `Layer.succeed`, `Layer.effect`, or
`Effect.provideService`. The module-level `layer` from `@yielded/agent/id-generator` restores
the default.

Use direct module paths when you need an individual module:

| Module or declarations                           | Owning module                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Agent constructors and inferred types            | `@yielded/agent/agent`                 |
| Recall composition, sources, and outcomes        | `@yielded/agent/memory`                |
| Memory passages and recall limits                | `@yielded/agent/memory-reference`      |
| Memory reader/writer contracts                   | `@yielded/agent/memory-store`          |
| Remembering checkpoints and persistence contract | `@yielded/agent/remembering-store`     |
| Durable admission and finite remembering passes  | `@yielded/agent/remembering`           |
| `MemoryAccess`, `revalidateMemoryLookup`         | `@yielded/agent/memory-revalidation`   |
| Semantic index contracts and errors              | `@yielded/agent/semantic-memory-index` |
| Delegation contracts and reservation amounts     | `@yielded/agent/subagent-contract`     |
| Runtime operations and inferred failures         | `@yielded/agent/agent-runtime`         |
| Native tool selection schemas and annotations    | `@yielded/agent/tool-exposure`         |
| Host tool visibility and eligible catalogue      | `@yielded/agent/tool-exposure`         |
| Bounded native and Code Mode discovery           | `@yielded/agent/tool-discovery`        |
| Compactor service                                | `@yielded/agent/context-compactor`     |
| Command-drain, scheduling, and run options       | `@yielded/agent/run-options`           |
| Subagent authoring and handlers                  | `@yielded/agent/subagent`              |
| Semantic indexing/query implementation           | `@yielded/agent/semantic-memory`       |

Import individual declarations from their owning modules, or use the root module namespace.
`CommandDrainPolicy` and `RunSchedulingOverride` each expose a Schema and its inferred type
from `RunOptions`. `MemoryThreadStoreLive` comes from
`@yielded/agent-storage-memory/memory-thread-store`; SQLite memory readers and writers come
from `@yielded/agent/sql-memory-store`.

Test controls and conformance suites use `/testing/module` paths. Browser adapters, fixtures,
and other specialized paths use the same kebab-case convention. Unlisted source files and
implementation directories are private.

Use `ContextCompactor` to customize compaction and `AgentPolicy.runStatus` to configure status
messages. Token estimators and `ContextCompactionState` support custom compactors.

<a id="compaction-and-unsupported-capabilities"></a>

### Limits and unsupported features

[MCP servers](/guide/tools/#mcp) connect through `McpClient.layer` over Streamable HTTP or stdio;
`connectMcp` bounds discovery and returns dynamic tools. Server-initiated sampling, elicitation,
resources, and prompts are not served.

[Background subagents](/guide/subagents/background/) and
[bounded nested delegation](/reference/subagents/#bound-nested-delegation) have public APIs.
Subagent handoff, runtime Skills, a framework-owned memory extraction or sharing policy,
arbitrary Thread metadata, and dynamic Turn Plans have no public APIs.
Applications own domain state. `Memory.recall` reads bounded passages from sources they select; it
does not store them. Thread history and compaction summaries do not replace application state.

Automatic compaction uses `ContextCompactor`. The separate
[artifact utilities](/guide/context-management/#explicit-compaction-artifacts) validate and apply
application-managed summaries; they do not run or persist automatically.

Scheduling and subscription ownership does not isolate thread storage.
Enforce [storage separation and authorization](/guide/operations/#authorization-and-isolation)
in your host.

## Packages

<a id="decision-models"></a>

### `@yielded/agent-ai-decision`

Thread-owned automatic model selection, using the native Effect `DecisionModel` service.
The package depends only on Effect and exports `AutoModel` and `LanguageModelDecisionModel`.
The latter adapts any structured-output language model to native decisions. Import ordinary assessments
from `effect/ai` using `Decision` and `DecisionModel`.
[`AutoModel`](/reference/decision-models/#automodel) selects a native model from described profiles on each thread's
first turn, including new subagents. A shared selection store retains choices across follow-ups.

Start with the [decision guide](/guide/tools/#decision-transitions), then use the
[API reference](/reference/decision-models/) for options and results.

<a id="typesafe-ai"></a>

### `@effect/ai-typesafe` (upstream)

The Jev adapter: `TypeSafeDecisionModel` supplies the shared decision service, while
`TypeSafeClient` and `TypeSafeSchema` expose the native choice, score, and noul API.
This upstream Effect provider replaces `@effect-agent/ai-typesafe` and uses an Effect HttpClient.

See [client configuration](/reference/decision-models/#typesafe-client) or wrap an assessment in a
[native Effect AI tool](/guide/tools/#typesafe-evaluations).

<a id="effect-agent-umbrella"></a>

### `@yielded/agent`

Agent definitions, schemas, execution, streaming, policies, subagents, memory capabilities,
MCP, durable execution, and platform-neutral sandbox contracts. It has no database driver or platform runtime dependency.
Start with `Agent`, `AgentRuntime`, and `InMemory.layer`.

`InMemory.layer` retains in-memory conversation history and shared attached-subagent reservations.
For storage-backed history, use the root namespace `PersistentHistory.layer`.
Models, provider clients, credentials, tool handlers, and durable hosts remain application choices.

`BrowserUse.make` (`@yielded/agent/browser-use`) returns a matching `toolkit` and `layer()`
for a model agent; it defaults to single actions, or `mode: "batched"`. `BrowserUse.runJev`
drives the page with a native Effect `DecisionModel` instead. Applications supply observed
controls and guarded actions through `BrowserActions`. See [browser tools](/guide/browser/#let-jev-drive-the-browser).

Sandbox contracts including `Sandbox`, `CodeExecutor`, `PageCapture`, and `InteractiveBrowser`
are part of this package; concrete executors and browser adapters are separate. See
[sandbox execution](/guide/sandbox/) and [browser tools](/guide/browser/).

### Source layout

```text
packages/effect-agent/src/
├─ core/           # agent definitions, Thread, schemas, identifiers
├─ engine/         # immediate execution and history integration
├─ capabilities/   # subagents, memory, MCP, tools
├─ sandbox/        # platform-neutral execution contracts
└─ durable/        # persistence, journals, recovery, scheduling
```

These are internal directories, not separate packages or import prefixes. Storage drivers,
platform hosts, workflow integrations, sandbox execution, and testing remain separate packages.

<a id="effect-agent-sandbox-local"></a>

### `@yielded/agent-sandbox-local`

Runs trusted code in local child processes. It reports `unisolated` and rejects policies
requiring isolation it cannot enforce.

Follow the [local process walkthrough](/guide/sandbox/#run-a-trusted-local-process).

### Threads and durability in `@yielded/agent`

`Thread` describes an identified, ordered conversation. `Thread.Store` holds in-memory snapshots
and `InMemory.layer` shares it across Runs. Persistence and execution recovery are separate choices.

Versioned records, storage contracts, recovery, scheduling, and subscriptions live under
`packages/effect-agent/src/durable`. Import their public namespaces from `@yielded/agent`, or use
kebab-case subpaths such as `@yielded/agent/persistent-history` and `@yielded/agent/durable-agent-runtime`.
`DurableAgentRuntime.layerRegistered` hashes version declarations and captures agent services
once at construction. `layerWithBindings` accepts previously compiled registrations owned by
the application's Scope. Worker operations use those registrations without accepting services.
Optional `processCommittedActivity` runs bounded, resumable passes with separate processor
progress. The host owns record eligibility, extraction, and durable output application. See
[committed memory processing](/guide/context-management/#committed-memory).

Custom drivers can advance one FIFO-head Attempt with `processThreadHead(threadId)` and apply one
submission's recovery decision with `recoverSubmission`. `submissionStatus` is the authorized
nonblocking read; `inspectSubmissionStatus` is reserved for trusted workers. Pending status and
an empty processing result do not imply completion.

<a id="effect-agent-workflow"></a>

### `@yielded/agent-workflow`

`AgentWorkflow.execute(agent, input, { name })` composes registered Agents inside native
`Workflow.toLayer` handlers. Stable step names deduplicate admission across replays; Effect's
`DurableDeferred` suspends and resumes the parent. Results are decoded from canonical
settlements, and `AgentWorkflow.Error` supplies the workflow's typed error Schema.

Import `AgentWorkflow` from the package root or use the direct
`@yielded/agent-workflow/agent-workflow` module. The `WorkflowExecution` module exports
the step options, Agent contract, and `WorkflowExecutionFailure` schema.

Optional `WorkflowAgentHost` over an injected upstream Effect `WorkflowEngine`. It reuses the
durable runtime's admission, journal recovery, authorization, and settlement protocol.
`WorkflowAgentHost.layer(options)` consumes a runtime whose Layer owns agent registration.
Its required `principal` supplies the identity for workflow-originated submissions.
`WorkflowDispatchStore` retains dispatch intents; `WorkflowRepairTrigger` requires the host to
schedule startup and repeated repair. The shared package starts no polling loop and imports no
Node or Cloudflare implementation.

See the [Effect Workflows guide](/guide/workflows/) for host composition, engine substitution,
and cancellation semantics, including the [Node.js SQL setup](/guide/workflows/#node).
Install it separately from `@yielded/agent`.

<a id="effect-agent-storage-memory"></a>

### `@yielded/agent-storage-memory`

Scoped in-memory thread and submission stores for tests. The ledger is non-durable.
For ordinary conversations, use [`InMemory.layer`](/storage/memory/) from `@yielded/agent`.
The independent `inMemorySemanticIndexLayer` supplies a bounded exact cosine derivative index.
It is disposable and must be rebuilt from authoritative sources after its Scope closes.

<a id="effect-agent-storage-sql"></a>

### `@yielded/agent-storage-sql`

Shared SQL implementations of thread history, submissions, schedules, subscriptions, message
delivery, and activity progress. SQLite and Postgres supply connections, format initialization,
and transaction settings. Cloudflare reuses the SQL helpers that fit Durable Objects.
Applications normally install their database adapter; adapter authors can use these factories
with Effect's `SqlClient`. The shared package imports no platform runtime.
`makeSqlThreadStore` and `makeSqlSubmissionLedger` return individual service values in Effects.
Durable adapters also need `SettlementPublisher`: `makeSqlSubmissionLedgerKernel` returns
co-owned `ledger` and `publisher` services over the supplied journal. Install them together
with `Layer.effectContext`, alongside the thread store built over that journal.

<a id="effect-agent-storage-sqlite"></a>

### `@yielded/agent-storage-sqlite`

Stores thread history and pending work in one Node SQLite database.
Accepts fresh databases or the exact current thread format; rejects mismatches without migration.
`CurrentSqliteStorageVersion` identifies the supported version.
See the [SQLite storage guide](/storage/sqlite/) for installation and agent wiring.

The independent `memoryStoreLayer` from `@yielded/agent/sql-memory-store` supplies optional `MemoryReader`, `MemoryWriter`, and `SqlMemoryBatchWriter` ports
for conditional document updates and terminal withdrawal. It initializes only memory tables.
Use `memoryReaderLayer` when the application needs no writer. See
[memory lifecycle](/guide/context-management/#memory-lifecycle).

`activityProcessorStoreLayer` provides independent leases, prepared output, and per-Thread
progress for finite committed-activity passes. Its tables and fencing epochs are separate from
the Thread journal and submission ledger.

<a id="effect-agent-storage-postgres"></a>

### `@yielded/agent-storage-postgres`

Stores thread history and pending work in one Postgres database, which several Node processes may
share. Rejects incompatible stored versions; no migration path is promised.
Requires Postgres 16 or newer.

`PostgresStorage.layer` provides `ThreadStore`, `ThreadReader`, `SubmissionLedger`, and
`SettlementPublisher`, requiring the application's native Effect `SqlClient` and `Crypto`.
See the [PostgreSQL storage guide](/storage/postgres/)
for client composition and agent wiring. Use `PostgresStorage.layerWith(options)` to configure
the core pair, or select individual ports:

| Constructor                                       | Provides                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `threadStoreLayer(options = {})`                  | `ThreadStore`, `ThreadReader`             |
| `submissionLedgerLayer(options = {})`             | `SubmissionLedger`, `SettlementPublisher` |
| `scheduleStoreLayer(options = {})`                | `ScheduleStore`                           |
| `activityStoreLayer(options = {})`                | `ActivityProcessorStore`                  |
| `messageDeliveryStoreLayer(options = {})`         | `MessageDeliveryStore`                    |
| `subscriptionStoreLayer(partition, options = {})` | `SubscriptionStore`                       |

These constructors are exported by `PostgresStorage`. Activity progress remains independent of
the journal; subscriptions require an explicit partition. Message delivery accepts `limits` in
its options. The `failpoint` and `activityFailpoint`
options accept test handlers.

The `schema` option qualifies storage tables and defaults to `public`. It leaves the client's
search path unchanged; pre-provisioned schemas need no database-wide `CREATE` permission.
Storage decodes native `BIGINT` values to safe integers and uses its persisted column names,
while application queries keep the client's codecs and name transformations.

Writes use `READ COMMITTED` and serialize on one transaction-scoped advisory lock. A lock timeout
appears as a retryable `PostgresWriteContention` cause in thread and submission errors; other stores
report their own storage errors. Invoke storage writes and snapshot reads outside an existing
SQL transaction: they own top-level transactions and reject nesting with a typed failure.
Identifiers and other text parameters must contain valid Unicode without NUL; canonical JSON
payloads still preserve arbitrary strings. The `@yielded/agent/sql-memory-store` ports stay
SQLite-only.

### `@yielded/agent-platform-node`

`NodeDurableHost.layer(registrations, options)` acquires storage, recovers pending work, and
starts a bounded worker pool. `NodeDurableHost.run` observes that pool and propagates worker
failure to the application. Provide the host Layer once around the supervised application;
its Scope closes admission and joins workers before releasing runtime resources.

Assembles SQLite storage, recovery, and workers through `NodeDurableHost`.
Registers agent bindings before execution, recovers before admission, and releases ownership
before closing storage. See the [Node.js guide](/platforms/node/).

`NodeDurableAgentRuntimeOptions.toolFailureObserver` installs a local tool-failure observer.

The optional `@yielded/agent-platform-node/node-workflow` import supplies `SqlWorkflowDispatchStore`
over an injected `SqlClient` and `NodeWorkflowRepairTrigger` with scoped startup and polling.
Pair them with `NodeDurableAgentRuntime.layerRegistered` and `WorkflowAgentHost.layer` as shown
in the [Workflow guide's Node.js setup](/guide/workflows/#node). This assembly does not start
the ordinary Node worker loop.

### `@yielded/agent-storage-cloudflare`

Stores history and pending work in each Durable Object's SQLite database.
Accepts injected Object handles without importing `cloudflare:workers`.
Rejects incompatible stored versions; `CurrentDoStorageVersion` identifies the supported version.
Failpoints and eviction helpers are in `@yielded/agent-storage-cloudflare/testing/do-storage-failpoint-testing`.
See [Cloudflare storage](/storage/cloudflare/) for host ownership and direct adapter use.

`doMemoryStoreLayer` supplies optional memory ports using storage-backed SQLite transactions.
The separate memory protocol defines bounded batch requests, responses, and typed errors.

### `@yielded/agent-platform-cloudflare`

Assembles the durable host, RPC client, alarms, and Code Mode executor.
See the [Cloudflare guide](/platforms/cloudflare/) for bindings, service lifetimes, and admission limits.
The [Code Mode guide](/guide/code-mode/#run-generated-code-on-cloudflare) covers the independent
Dynamic Worker executor and Worker Loader binding.
`ThreadObject.Options.toolFailureObserver` installs a local tool-failure observer.

`MemoryObject.make` and `CloudflareMemoryClient` share namespace-owned memory across
Threads, with one authoritative batch RPC per recall. See [shared memory](/platforms/cloudflare/#shared-memory).

Browser adapters use separate imports:

| Subpath                 | Adapter and requirements                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/cloudflare-browser`   | Page capture through a browser binding; structured extraction also needs explicit Workers AI authorization and accounting |
| `/browser-rest-capture` | Node-safe page capture with account credentials and `HttpClient`                                                          |
| `/browser-rest-crawl`   | Node-safe same-host Markdown crawl with bounded polling and scoped job cleanup                                            |
| `/interactive-browser`  | Bounded interactive browser and host controls with the included Puppeteer client                                          |
| `/browser-session`      | Host-owned native sessions, scoped attachments, operator controls, keepalive, and exact-session cleanup                   |
| `/browser-credentials`  | Login/card fill schemas and invocation-specific credential authority; fills the current native page                       |

Durable hosts and the stateless browser adapters do not load Puppeteer.

See [browser setup and limits](/guide/browser/) for credentials, network policies,
action failures, and cleanup.

#### Browser session options

`BrowserSessions.layer({ browser, accountId, apiToken })` requires `HttpClient`.
`create(options, retain)` calls the host's retention Effect with a private
`BrowserSessionReference`; successful retention makes the host responsible for remote cleanup.
`createAttached(options, retain)` returns a `BrowserSession` after the same retention step,
keeping its initial connection in the caller's `Scope`. Failed acquisition releases the child
scope before returning the failure. Its 30-second acquisition timeout does not cover subsequent
commands; each command uses the reference's remaining expiry and command timeout.
`attach(reference)` acquires a local connection in `Scope`. Its finalizer disconnects locally.

| Creation option        | Default  | Meaning                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxElapsedMillis`     | Required | Positive safe integer; fixes the session's absolute expiry     |
| `keepAliveMillis`      | `600000` | Requested provider idle allowance, from 1 through 600,000 ms   |
| `commandTimeoutMillis` | `30000`  | Positive safe integer; bounds each authorized native operation |

The reference stores redacted session, context, and page identities, `expiresAt`, and
`commandTimeoutMillis`. Keep it in private host storage. `keepAlive(sessionId)` refreshes
provider inactivity without changing `expiresAt`; `close(sessionId)` requires confirmed
termination or exact-session absence. The owner supplies its existing expiry/cleanup trigger.
Provider expiry can happen sooner; attachment never creates a replacement session.

`session.run(authorize, action)` checks current host authority under the attachment's lock before
passing its native Puppeteer page to trusted code. The host owns network policy, output bounds,
controller fencing, and action receipts. `handoff`, `getLiveView`, and `getHandoffState` take the
same authorization Effect and use the existing `BrowserRun` request/result schemas.
Await all SDK work inside the native callback. A settled SDK rejection preserves the session for
inspection while reporting uncertain dispatch; unfinished or unsafe operations can terminate it.
Neither outcome authorizes automatic replay.

`session.fillCredential(request)` requires `BrowserCredentialAccess` for each call. Its
`FillCredentialRequest` selects 1–8 fields by explicit selector and role within one native form;
an optional `frame` path selects at most eight nested iframes. The service authorizes current
origins and resolves host-only material. The helper fills without submitting and returns only
dispatch evidence and the number of acknowledged writes. Ordinary browser observations remain
available after filling.
If a fill times out, `CredentialFillError` reports `reason: "timeout"`, the acknowledged
`filled` count, dispatch evidence, and whether browser cleanup was confirmed. A pending write
reply remains `possibly-dispatched`; its assignment is not included in `filled`.
