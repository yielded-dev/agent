<a id="architecture"></a>

Understand how Yielded Agent runs work, bounds its resources, and recovers recorded progress.
These pages explain the contracts behind the [implementation guides](/guide/).

## Agent execution

[The runtime model](/concepts/runtime-model/) defines the turn, ownership, recovery, and wake rules
shared by runtime, storage, and platform changes.

## Budgets and limits

[Budgets and bounded autonomy](/concepts/budgets/) explains execution ceilings, shared delegation
allowances, token limits, and cost accounting.

## Durability and recovery

[Persistence and durability](/concepts/durability/) explains accepted work, recorded results,
ownership loss, child recovery, and uncertain external effects.

For host-specific setup, see [Platforms](/platforms/). For package boundaries and
advanced configuration, see [Reference](/reference/).
