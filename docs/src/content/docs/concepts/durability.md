Persistent history retains conversations; durable execution also recovers accepted work after
process loss. The [runtime model](/concepts/runtime-model/) defines ownership and settlement. This page
covers recovery boundaries and adapter contracts; see [Threads](/guide/threads/) for history setup.

## Execution modes

| Class | Meaning                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `E`   | in-memory history; execution has no process-loss recovery  |
| `P`   | persistent history; execution has no process-loss recovery |
| `DN`  | durable admission and recovery on Node and SQLite          |
| `DC`  | the same contract on Cloudflare Durable Objects            |

Choose a deployment class and adapter with the recovery guarantees your application needs.
See the [Node.js](/platforms/node/) and [Cloudflare](/platforms/cloudflare/) guides for setup.

## Rebuild from the log

Replay rebuilds state from canonical records without executing tools. Projections and checkpoints
are disposable; retain canonical records when rebuilding them.

An Attempt captures a fixed canonical tail and validates contiguous pages. Without a recovery
checkpoint, it gathers control and journal metadata together, including compaction boundaries.
Later appends enter through a separately captured suffix; a gap or short page fails before that
view can drive recovery. Compaction metadata is discarded after projection, before model waits.
Canonical prompt and unresolved-tool validation still apply, including when reusing metadata.

`ThreadProjection` version 3 derives open tool calls from committed model responses and scopes
calls and subagent invocations by Run and Tool Call ID. Decode projection state with its Schema
before replaying a suffix. Earlier versions, including empty views, must be discarded and rebuilt
from canonical records.

## Complete a submission

The storage owner publishes one canonical `SubmissionSettled` record after checking the current
claim, joined host, or queued abort authority in the same transaction. Delivery and parent
acknowledgements complete before ledger finalization releases the lane. Finalization derives the
outcome from that record and preserves its first finalization timestamp on every retry.

A crash before publication resumes from existing execution facts: a committed `RunCompleted`
retains its output, while unresolved ordinary tools remain uncertain. A crash after publication
repeats notifications and finalization without choosing another outcome. There is no separate
settlement reservation or reserved-record recovery phase.

## Resume through a recovery checkpoint

After a durable compaction or context rollover commits its replacement, the runtime can save a
recovery checkpoint through `ThreadStore.recoveryCheckpoints`. The checkpoint preserves the
replacement context, protected instructions and input, cumulative usage and policy accounting,
the latest replayable tool batch, and required control and Durable Step evidence. Completed Step
results remain available for reuse after an ownership change.

Checkpoints also retain retired application call IDs, so compaction never permits their reuse
within the same Run.

When that Run completes, an eligible checkpoint also preserves the complete Thread's canonical
conversation. A later Run can start from that context and its own records, with fresh instructions
and accounting. Each completion refreshes the context from the new records, so sequential Runs
need not reread the retired archive. The snapshot contains canonical messages, never transient
context or provider-only prompt transformations.
If retaining the completed Run's recovery data would exceed cache bounds, the snapshot keeps
only Thread context and identity records; recovering that Run uses canonical history.

This optional cache holds one latest snapshot per Thread. Saves require the current producer
epoch and bind the snapshot to a canonical batch tail. It is separate from the generic
`ThreadStore.checkpoints` slot used by application projections. Neither slot changes canonical
history or owns a submission.

Recovery checks the checkpoint's versions, state digest, agent/model/tool definitions, retained
submissions, and canonical binding before replaying the suffix. The suffix is limited to 4,096
records, read in pages of at most 1,024. Missing, corrupt, incompatible, or ineligible checkpoints
fall back to the captured canonical prefix. A longer or incompatible suffix also uses full replay;
cache capacity never justifies dropping control or Step evidence. Storage infrastructure failures
remain typed failures.

Cross-Run reuse requires proven original-input boundaries and an unambiguous, single-Run suffix.
Opaque Submission IDs, including Cloudflare's routed IDs, can reuse context when their lengths
match the checkpoint owner's. A different length, ambiguous control markers, interleaved
continuations, late results, joined settlements, or a new compaction can require full replay.
New compaction reconstructs canonical coverage and certifies another snapshot. This also replaces
checkpoints from an incompatible runtime version; caching resumes after that compaction. Context
without compaction can still grow with the conversation; a checkpoint does not make every Thread
operation independent of history size.

The canonical log and submission ledger remain authoritative. A history-search index supplies
retrieval candidates and cannot stand in for this recovery state. Ordinary unresolved tools keep
the same reconciliation and unknown-outcome rules with or without a checkpoint.

## Track unfinished work

An unknown Submission without abort intent is parked: later input can run in the same Thread
while the original settlement obligation stays open.
Suspended, joining, and joined work retain their ordering barriers. At most one live owner can
claim a Thread; a wake hint does not acquire ownership or advance its fencing epoch.

A host can opt into `SubmissionScheduling.yieldTo` to handle the next same-Agent input in its
own Run after a completed Turn. The prior Attempt closes before the next one acquires ownership;
principals, captured inputs, receipts and reply identities remain separate. Keep independent inputs
out of `claimJoining`. The policy cannot bypass an admission gap, pending approval or child wait,
and does not interrupt in-flight model requests or Tool batches. Deferred Runs remain owed and
resume with their original authority and deadlines. Their model context contains history preceding
their start and their own Turns. Later results can close prior historical calls, but another Run's
continuation cannot replace the current input. Compaction covers its creator's context while
complete Thread history retains interleaved exchanges from other Runs.
Recovery checkpoints from the previous context projection rebuild from canonical history.
Install matching runtime and storage packages.

`SubmissionLedger.scanNonterminal` discovers work through `SubmissionWorkItem`: identities,
receipt, deployment, queue order and state, without execution payloads. Read `lookup` or
`loadRecoverySnapshot` only for selected work. Recovery hydrates each Thread inside its fault
boundary, so an unreadable retained input or worker origin cannot poison global discovery.

`runRecovery()` isolates history, retained payload and child-recovery faults by Thread. It returns ordinary
Submission `reports` and one `blocked` fault per failed Thread. Blocked Threads cannot be
claimed until recovery succeeds. Pass `{ threadId }` to recover a selected Thread independently.
The host owns durable fault visibility and retry scheduling outside the execution log. The
default cooperative recovery bound is 30 seconds per Thread (`recoveryTimeout`). Interruption
and global SQL/control-identity scan failures still fail the sweep. A recovery fault never settles accepted work,
proves an external effect failed, or authorizes replay.

## Exactly-once recording

Recovery records `UnknownToolOutcome` when an ordinary tool may have acted without a recorded
result. It cannot safely infer failure or replay the call. Durable Steps reuse recorded results;
their external execution can repeat and still needs idempotency or reconciliation.

Step identity includes the Run ID, Tool Call ID, and Step name. New Step record and batch IDs use
a versioned JSON tuple so separator characters cannot merge distinct Steps. Recovery derives
the same identity from each recorded payload, preserving completed Steps stored with older IDs
without executing their bodies again.

## Workflow recovery

The optional [`WorkflowAgentHost`](/guide/workflows/) drives this runtime through an
injected Effect `WorkflowEngine`. Replacing the engine Layer leaves the agent definitions and
durable driver unchanged. See the guide for host composition and platform setup.

Each native Workflow advances a submission through journal recovery and bounded Attempts.
Pending work, approvals, unknown outcomes, and native suspension remain unfinished until the
canonical log contains a Settlement. Infrastructure failures suspend the Workflow for repair.
Ordinary tools remain ordinary tools; the driver does not wrap them in replayable Activities.

Inside an application Workflow, `AgentWorkflow.execute` assigns each named step a stable
submission identity and awaits an upstream `DurableDeferred`. The dispatch intent retains its
completion token until repair delivers a reference to the canonical Settlement. Notification
and cleanup are separate recoverable commits. A resumed handler rechecks admission identity and
authorization and decodes the canonical result; the deferred does not store a second copy of
the Agent output. Parent interruption detaches the caller without cancelling accepted work.

Admission, dispatch intent storage, and native Workflow storage commit independently. A required
host-owned repair trigger discovers accepted work and retries retained dispatch intents after
lost hints or process loss. An intent remains until native success identifies the matching
canonical Settlement. No cross-database transaction encloses an agent execution.

Interrupting an observer or settlement waiter detaches it. Abort and resolution commands use the
durable runtime's authorization and intent protocol. Native Workflow interruption is not the
agent cancellation API. Each Attempt releases its ownership and resources before suspension.

## Retain resources while awaiting approval

`AgentRegistration.attemptLayer` owns services for one fenced Attempt. Its resources finalize
when the Attempt completes, suspends, fails, or is interrupted. A replacement Attempt builds
fresh services around any externally retained resource.

When an approval wait must retain a resource, provide `DurableApprovalSuspension` from that same
Layer. This optional `Effect<void, ApprovalSuspensionError>` captures the live services and finishes
the host's checkpoint and handoff before returning. Import both names from
`@yielded/agent/durable-agent-runtime`. Wrap typed failures in `ApprovalSuspensionError.make({ cause })`
using `Effect.catchCause` and `Cause.map` to preserve accompanying defects and interruptions.

The runtime calls it after recording the approval request, while claim renewal and abort observation
remain active. Failure preserves its cause and leaves accepted work owed; interruption runs normal
cleanup. If approval arrives during retention, the old services and claim finalize before a fresh
Attempt resumes the same Run's pending tool batch. Completed tools are not repeated, and unresolved
ordinary effects still require reconciliation.

## Admission and recovery

The runtime returns a Receipt after durable ledger admission, thread materialization, and
readiness. Reusing an admission key with the same input returns the same Receipt. Different input
conflicts. Admission sequence sets queue order.

Each producer write checks its ownership token and epoch. A stale attempt cannot append after a
replacement takes ownership. Recovery uses the same current binding selection as execution (unique stable Agent ID by
default, or explicit host selection from the canonical Submission). It validates a strongly
consistent canonical prefix before classifying the last committed boundary:

| Last committed boundary                           | Recovery                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| admission without readiness                       | finish materialization and readiness                                         |
| ready input with no attempted execution           | leave input application to the normal worker claim                           |
| input appended without its ledger marker          | repair the marker without applying input twice                               |
| `RunStarted`                                      | preserve the original deadline                                               |
| incomplete model response                         | retry inference when policy allows; provider charges may repeat              |
| committed ordinary mutating call without a result | reconcile or record `UnknownToolOutcome`                                     |
| initial pending or denied approval                | preserve the blocked batch; no handler started                               |
| canonical tool or Durable Step result             | reuse the recorded result                                                    |
| `RunCompleted`                                    | preserve stored output and disposition; validate `resultDigest` when present |
| reserved settlement                               | append that outcome, then finalize the ledger idempotently                   |
| canonical settlement without ledger finalization  | finalize from history                                                        |

Joined input follows the same rule. Claimed input without a canonical append returns to ready.
Appended input rejoins its host run and settles with it. Approval must be canonical before work
resumes. Unknown work releases execution permits while keeping its accepted obligation open.
Abort preserves evidence and cannot roll back external effects or replace a settlement that won.
See [Operations](/guide/operations/).

Application tool call IDs must be unique within a Run; a reused ID is rejected before dispatch.
The committed model response owns each call's normalized arguments and original execution class,
kind, and replay hash. There is no separate preparation record. Losing ownership immediately
after that response commits can therefore leave an ordinary mutating call unknown, even if its
handler had not started. Execution still validates arguments, resolves the whole batch's approvals,
checks host authorization, and rechecks the writer fence before granting handler permits.

A pending or denied approval recorded before the original dispatch proves that the whole batch
never started. An initially blocked approval flow retains this proof across resumes until dispatch;
an approval after possible execution cannot restore it. Parameter rejection proves nonexecution
of its individual call. Approved calls without results remain uncertain.

Recovery uses the original recorded arguments and operation contract. `CompletedWithResult`
injects a confirmed result; `NeverStarted` proves nonexecution. `SafeToRetry` permits another
attempt under compatible original semantics, but cannot authorize changed code or erase uncertainty.
Readonly and idempotent calls retain their declared replay behavior. Unsupported effects stay unknown.

Later model requests preserve earlier user intent, assistant text, and settled sibling results.
Missing results remain explicitly unknown unless canonical evidence proves nonexecution. This
explanatory history creates no tool settlement and cannot resolve an effect. Compaction retains
unresolved declarations. Recovered discovery selections keep only currently defined tools; newly
added tools do not enter the saved selection. A committed `RunCompleted` output and disposition
remain authoritative across later codec or completion-projector changes.

## Attached subagents

A [durable attached child](/guide/subagents/durable-attached/) owns a separate thread and attempt.
The waiting parent releases its worker permit; recovery rejoins the existing child.

Recovery preserves child identity and checks the registered tool's delegation classification.
Missing or conflicting classification fails closed. If admission cannot confirm whether a child
was accepted, the parent keeps waiting; it never starts a replacement child.

Joining verifies the child's settlement, lineage, and definition digests, decodes and bounds the
projected result, and commits it atomically with the parent tool result. Child transcripts remain
private unless the projection exposes them.

Budget release happens once. A crash may hold a reservation until repair, but cannot make it
available twice. Run accounting survives replacement attempts, including pending turns,
programmatic calls, failure streaks, usage, cost, and the original deadline. A reservation made
before a crash may consume allowance even when the corresponding work never executes.

Parent abort records intent for each child and joins the child's terminal outcome before settling
the parent. Unknown child effects remain operator obligations. After the parent deadline, recovery
may finish child abort, join, and accounting work. It cannot start a child, call application
projectors, run tools, or continue the model.
