title: Agent definitions
description: Define agents with schemas, tools, instructions, and run limits.
---

<a id="agent-definitions"></a>

An agent definition contains schemas, instructions, a native Effect AI toolkit, and a finite
policy. The application supplies model services and other dependencies when it runs the agent.

```ts
const definition = Agent.make("support-triage", {
  input: SupportRequest,
  output: Resolution,
  instructions,
  toolkit: SupportToolkit,
  policy,
});

const run = AgentRuntime.run(definition, input).pipe(Effect.provide(ClaudeModel));
```

Definitions contain no provider client, database connection, mutable thread, or acquired
resource. Reuse one definition across many runs. Effect Schema supplies the data types and runtime
validation; provider wire schemas derive from those definitions.

<a id="definition-contract"></a>

## Build a definition

`Agent.make` requires an ID, input and output schemas, instructions, and a toolkit.
Declare ordinary limits as a plain `policy` object; `Agent.make` validates it and fills defaults.
A complete `AgentPolicy` value is also accepted. Standalone defaults are
12 turns, 24 tool calls, 5 minutes, and tool concurrency 4. Other defaults follow `AgentPolicy.make`.
Delegated children inherit omitted policy fields from their parent. Supply a partial object
to inherit individual fields; `AgentPolicy.make` fills its own defaults before inheritance.
Definitions retain the explicit fields as `policyOverrides`; `policy` holds their standalone values.
It also accepts `inputPrompt`, `completion`, `runDisposition`, a description, and metadata.

Instructions may be static prompt input or a function of decoded input. That function may return
an `Effect`. Its errors and service requirements become part of the run type.

## Choose final-output format

Output Schemas use JSON final messages by default. For ordinary assistant text, wrap the complete
Schema with `Output.text`. The Schema must encode as a string; its checks, transformations, and
service requirements still apply.

```ts twoslash
import { Output } from "@yielded/agent";
import { Schema } from "effect";

const Reply = Output.text(Schema.String.check(Schema.isMaxLength(20_000)));
// Pass Reply as Agent.make(..., { output: Reply, ... }).
```

The runtime instructs the model to reply without JSON wrapping and decodes that text directly.
Whitespace, quotes, and empty replies are preserved. Use `Schema.NonEmptyString` when silence is
invalid. Apply `Output.text` after composing the Schema. Required completion tools still take
precedence; optional completion tools retain their own parameter contract. Durable records store
the validated string as a JSON string value. Metadata does not select an output format.
Once `RunCompleted` records validated output, recovery preserves that stored
value without decoding it through a later output Schema.

## Choose model-visible input

The runtime normally sends the complete schema-encoded input as a JSON user message. Use
`inputPrompt` to send a smaller or differently shaped value.

```ts
const definition = Agent.make("support-triage", {
  input: Schema.Struct({ question: Schema.String, authorizationToken: Schema.String }),
  output: Resolution,
  instructions: "Answer the customer's question.",
  inputPrompt: ({ question }) =>
    Effect.succeed(Prompt.make([{ role: "user", content: [{ type: "text", text: question }] }])),
  toolkit: SupportToolkit,
  policy,
});
```

`inputPrompt` receives decoded input and returns native Effect AI `Prompt.RawInput`, directly or
through an `Effect`. Strings become user messages. Prompts and message arrays keep their roles,
parts, provider options, and multimodal content. Return an empty Prompt or message array to omit
the input message. Its errors and service requirements join the run's `E` and `R`.

The runtime builds the source from history, instructions, and projected input, then applies context
preparation and compaction. Outgoing requests place system instructions and the output contract
before the conversation; optional transient context and run status follow the conversation. See
[Context management](/guide/context-management/).

Projection changes only model-visible input. Durable admission still stores the complete encoded
input, and tool authorization receives it. Keep secrets out of instructions and apply separate
disclosure rules to history, tool results, steering, and host context transforms.

Durable attempts may evaluate the projection again. Committed turns keep their recorded projected
messages. Projection effects must tolerate another evaluation and must not assume exactly-once
external execution.

A projection failure stops the run before the next model request. The runtime never falls back to
the full input. Projection services, errors, interruption, and deadlines follow normal Effect
semantics.

## Provide native model services

Models are execution requirements: use `Effect.provide` for a Run, `Stream.provide` for a
stream, and `Layer.provide` for subagent handlers.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Layer, Stream } from "effect";
import { AgentRuntime, Subagent } from "@yielded/agent";
import { ModelLive, planner } from "./node-agent.ts";
import { Research } from "./delegation.ts";
// ---cut---
const program = AgentRuntime.run(planner, "Plan a weekend in Lisbon.").pipe(
  Effect.provide(ModelLive),
);

const events = AgentRuntime.stream(planner, "Plan a weekend in Lisbon.").pipe(
  Stream.provide(ModelLive),
);

const ResearchLive = Subagent.layer(Research).pipe(Layer.provide(ModelLive));
```

`run`, `stream`, and `start` require `LanguageModel.LanguageModel`, `Model.ProviderName`, and
`Model.ModelName`. Native Effect model Layers provide all three; their client requirements
remain visible until the application supplies them. Supply tool handlers and history alongside
those clients. Keep the model Layer around both `start` and the detached run's lifetime.

`Subagent.layer` captures the supplied model when its handler Layer is built. Use
`Layer.provideMerge(ModelLive)` when an assembled Layer should expose that model to the parent
too; the [attached-subagent walkthrough](/guide/subagents/in-memory-attached/) shows the complete setup.
[AutoModel](/reference/decision-models/#automodel) satisfies the same requirement and selects
once on each thread's first turn, including each new child.

The model Layer must have no construction error. Put fallible setup in the enclosing Layer or
Effect. When constructing a service that needs to reuse a model, capture its client dependencies:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { AgentRuntime } from "@yielded/agent";
import { ModelLive, planner } from "./node-agent.ts";
// ---cut---
const captured = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const modelLayer = yield* ModelLive.captureRequirements;
  return yield* AgentRuntime.run(planner, "Plan a weekend in Lisbon.").pipe(
    Effect.provide(modelLayer),
  );
});
```

```ts
type BeforeModel = Agent.DefinitionRequirements<typeof definition>;
type ExecutionRequirements = Agent.Requirements<typeof definition>;
type Failure = Agent.Failure<typeof definition>;
```

Selecting between several definitions produces the union of their errors and requirements.
Provide every branch or narrow the selection before execution. Optional explicit bindings are
covered in the [API reference](/reference/packages/#model-requirements).

## Resume across deployments

Keep Thread identities independent of deployment fingerprints. The original admission, input,
principal, digests, idempotency key and Receipt remain immutable. Register one current executable
per stable `agentId` and optionally declare each Tool's replay version:

```ts
const registration = {
  agent: definition,
  model: modelLayer,
  definitions: deploymentDefinitions,
  continuity: {
    versions: {
      tools: { search: "search-command" },
    },
  },
};
```

When `continuity.versions` is supplied, include every current Tool. Each version is a JSON value;
change it when handler meaning, durable Step codecs or names, external idempotency keys,
authorization semantics, completion projection, or child/report protocols change. Registration hashes
that version with the Tool's schemas, failure mode, approval policy, execution class, kind, and
completion or context-rollover role. Without explicit
versions, it uses the Tool definitions declaration as the version. JSON Schema cannot detect
changed handler code or codec transforms, so keep those declarations accurate.

Queued and resumed work selects the current binding by `agentId`. Historical Agent or toolbox
digests do not gate execution. A committed continuation retains its original input and prompt;
static instructions do not require a future input codec to accept that value. Input-dependent
instructions still decode their required input. An incompatible current input Schema returns
`BindingUnavailable` and leaves the original Receipt owed. Admission, lineage, and prepared
delivery evidence remain exact and are never rewritten.

Recovery checks each pending operation against its recorded execution contract. A changed or
removed mutating Tool that was never dispatched receives `ToolUnavailable` with
`execution: "not-executed"`, allowing the model to continue with current Tools. If an effect may
have occurred, the call stays unknown unless reconciliation supplies proof. Absence of a prepared
record does not prove that readonly work never ran. See
[operation recovery](/concepts/durability/#admission-and-recovery).

Hosts with deferred bindings can compile current metadata without acquiring executable services:

```ts
import { AgentRegistration } from "@yielded/agent";
import { Effect } from "effect";

const metadata = Effect.gen(function* () {
  return yield* AgentRegistration.compileBindingContracts(definition, definitions, {
    tools: { search: "search-command" },
  });
});
```

The Effect returns `{ digests }` and requires Crypto. Use those digests in the deferred binding.
There is no historical manifest or Agent replay-version registry to maintain.

For a low-level binding without per-operation hashes, the Tool digest supplies the operation
version. Direct `processThread` execution without a current registration uses `deploymentId`
instead. Reusing that ID asserts unchanged handler, Durable Step, and idempotency semantics;
unfinished mutations crossing deployments need registered per-operation versions or reconciliation.

Cloudflare maintenance persists bounded per-lane retries for missing current bindings and
continues other eligible lanes. Reinstantiation retains the backoff; registering the missing Agent
resumes the same Receipt. Parked unknown operations do not block later input in their Thread.

Durable `maxDuration` bounds each active Attempt using its original recorded allowance. Time
spent evicted, waiting for a binding, or suspended does not consume execution time. An actual
duration exhaustion is recorded before child cleanup and survives recovery. The Run's start time
and cumulative turn, Tool and cost accounting are unchanged; immutable worker authorization
expiry still limits execution. Roll out the matching runtime and storage packages together before
writing the new duration record; older runtimes cannot read it.

## Typed and external inputs

The main operations accept `Agent.EncodedInput<typeof definition>`. The runtime decodes that value
before instructions run. For `Schema.NumberFromString`, callers pass a string and instructions
receive a number.

Encode a decoded value with `Schema.encodeEffect(definition.input)`. Use `runUnknown`,
`streamUnknown`, or `startUnknown` for untrusted external data. Invalid input fails with
`AgentInputDecodeError` before instructions or model execution.

## Complete through a tool

Set `completion` when a successful tool result should become the agent's output without another
model turn. The projector receives decoded tool parameters and result:

```ts twoslash
import { Agent } from "@yielded/agent";
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect";
import { Tool, Toolkit } from "effect/ai";

const Answer = Schema.Struct({ answer: Schema.String });
const Complete = Tool.make("complete", { parameters: Answer, success: Schema.Void });
const Tools = Toolkit.make(Complete);

export const Definition = Agent.make("answer-question", {
  input: Schema.Struct({ question: Schema.String }),
  output: Answer,
  instructions: "Answer the question using the complete tool.",
  toolkit: Tools,
  policy: {
    maxTurns: 3,
    maxToolCalls: 3,
    maxDuration: "30 seconds",
  },
  completion: {
    tool: "complete",
    required: true,
    project: ({ parameters }) => parameters,
  },
});

export const ToolsLive = Tools.toLayer({ complete: () => Effect.void });
```

Provide `ToolsLive` with the model and history services when running this definition.
The output schema validates the projected value. With `required: true`, each turn must call a
tool and completion must use the named tool. Without it, valid final assistant JSON may also
complete the run. [Exhaustion policy](/concepts/budgets/#exhaustion-final-answer-or-failure)
controls the last available turn.

A completion tool must be the only application call, after any other needed application tool
results arrive. Completed provider work, such as hosted web search with a terminal result, may
appear in the same response and still counts toward run budgets. When a model mixes a completion
tool with other application calls, the engine rejects those application calls before any handler
starts and returns one `ModelProtocolError` result per rejected call. Provider results are retained.
The next ordinary turn can correct the declaration. Each rejected call counts toward `maxToolCalls` and
`repeatedFailureLimit`; model usage, turns, cost, and duration remain charged to the same run.
There is no separate retry allowance. A batch of three rejected calls can therefore exhaust the
default repeated-failure limit immediately. Budget exhaustion still controls finalization, and an
invalid finalization batch fails without another correction.

This correction also applies to `completionFromTools`. Provider calls without terminal results,
context rollover mixed with other calls, and invalid application batches recovered as pending work
still fail: pending durable calls cannot safely be treated as unexecuted. Recovery permits one
completion call alongside recorded terminal provider results, using recorded application results
when available and never replaying an uncertain ordinary side effect. Finalization after budget
exhaustion still permits only the advertised completion tool, with no provider calls. Completed
rejections are retained atomically with their failed results and survive recovery without replay.
Ordinary valid tool batches keep their configured concurrency. `ToolCallFailed` events identify
each rejected call by name and ID; turn events show correction attempts and the terminal run event
reports their outcome.

`completion` decides how a run finishes. `runDisposition` labels its successful output for
durable readers.

Use `completionFromTools` for an action whose committed result can satisfy the whole request,
while retaining a separate `completion` tool for ordinary replies. Each declaration names a tool
and provides a pure projector returning `Option.some(output)` or `Option.none()`:

```ts
completionFromTools: [{
  tool: "complete_action",
  project: ({ parameters, result }) =>
    parameters.wholeRequestSatisfied && result.status === "committed"
      ? Option.some(`Created [${result.name}](${result.href}).`)
      : Option.none(),
}],
```

Import `Option` from `effect`. The tool's schemas define the parameters and result in this example.
Only opt in tools with an explicit whole-request contract; completing the first step of a larger
request must not end the run. Return `None` for pending approval, partial, or otherwise insufficient
results. A declared tool failure also continues normally. Invalid output or a throwing projector
fails the run, rather than treating an unconfirmed result as success.

These action tools must be the only call in their batch and obey ordinary tool, turn, and token
budgets. They cannot execute in the reserved finalization turn; the existing `completion` tool
retains that role. Authorization, approvals, cancellation, and durable tool replay rules remain
unchanged. Recovery re-evaluates the projector from canonical parameters and results, so it must
be deterministic and perform no effects. Tool names must be distinct across completion declarations.

## Declare application completion explicitly

Use `runDisposition` when durable readers need an application-defined classification in addition
to the framework settlement outcome.

```ts
const RunDisposition = Schema.Literal("application-complete");

const definition = Agent.make("support-triage", {
  input: SupportRequest,
  output: Resolution,
  instructions,
  toolkit: SupportToolkit,
  policy,
  runDisposition: {
    schema: RunDisposition,
    fromOutput: (resolution) => resolution.runDisposition,
  },
});
```

The selector receives decoded output and may return `undefined`. The schema validates and encodes
any returned value. Invalid output fails with `AgentRunDispositionError`.

Only an ordinary completed durable run stores the encoded disposition on
`SubmissionSettled.runDisposition`. Budget exhaustion, failure, abort, and incomplete recovery
store none. Parse it with the same application schema. Do not infer completion from prose or tool
success.

## Stable identity

The string passed to `Agent.make` becomes a branded `AgentId` and contributes to durable identity
and definition digests. Renaming it creates a new identity. Before 1.0, stored data has no
migration promise.

## Policy is part of the program

For a reusable validated policy value, import the Schema declaration directly:

```ts twoslash
import { AgentPolicy } from "@yielded/agent/agent-policy";

AgentPolicy.make({
  maxTurns: 12,
  maxToolCalls: 24,
  maxDuration: "5 minutes",
  toolConcurrency: 4,
  repeatedFailureLimit: 3,
  tokenBudget: 80_000,
  costBudgetMicrousd: 2_000_000,
  onExhaustion: "final-answer",
});
```

Turns, tool calls, duration, and concurrency need positive finite bounds. Token and cost budgets
are optional because some models do not report enough usage data.

The default `onExhaustion: "final-answer"` allows one constrained final answer for turn, tool call,
or token exhaustion. The result uses `finishReason: "budget-exhausted"`. See
[Budgets & bounded autonomy](/concepts/budgets/) for all exhaustion rules and
[Context management](/guide/context-management/) for tool result bounds, run status, context limits,
and compaction.
