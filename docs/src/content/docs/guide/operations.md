description: Inspect, authorize, recover, and back up durable work.
---

<a id="operations"></a>

A durable host must expose accepted work, explain blocked work, and recover it safely. The same
administration contract applies to Node and SQLite class `DN` and Cloudflare Durable Objects class
`DC`.

<a id="administrative-operations"></a>

## Inspect and retry work

`DurableAgentRuntime` provides five operator functions:

- `explain(submissionId)` and `explainThread(threadId)` return the recovery decision,
  operator meaning, and expected disposition. They write nothing.
- `verify(threadId)` runs read-only integrity checks. The digest-chain check reports
  `skipped` unless the host supplies producer identity.
- `retry(RetryCommand.make({ submissionId, author, reason }))` logs the operator and repeats the classifier's
  decision. Repairs with a claim annotate their attempt using that claim's epoch; state-only wakes
  and marker repairs do not append canonical audit records. Retry refuses settled work and requests
  awaiting `resolveUnknown` or `resolveApproval`.
- `wake(threadId)` sends a droppable liveness hint without taking ownership or advancing an epoch.
- `scanObligations(thresholds)` reports blocked or aging accepted work.

`NodeDurableHost` exposes all five. Use
`vp run admin:durable <explain|verify|retry|wake|obligations> --database <file>` on Node.
Stop an automatically managed Node host before opening this separate CLI connection; use the
live host's methods for administration while its exclusive database lock is held.
Cloudflare Thread Objects expose encoded administration methods through the application's
Worker.

The `explain --thread <id> --json` payload is an array of recovery explanations, including `[]`
when the lane has no nonterminal work. `explain --submission <id> --json` returns one explanation
object.

`evidence.pendingOperations` derives unresolved calls from their original committed model
responses, including parameters, execution class, kind, and replay hash. `unknownCalls[].resolved`
means a canonical `ToolCallSettled` exists. Accepted resolution intents appear separately in
`unknownResolutions`; an intent alone is not a recorded result.

The administrative methods above, observation, settlement waits, abort, and unknown or approval
resolution consult `OperationAuthorizer`. Its default allows trusted service holders. Install a
real authorizer before exposing these methods outside a trusted host. Denial fails as
`OperationDenied` before protected I/O. The host must authorize admissions before calling `submit`.

## Read canonical work

Use `explain` to inspect unresolved effects and their original declarations. A committed tool call
may have executed even when no result was recorded; declaration alone grants no execution authority.

For exact receipts, use `ThreadStore.getRecord({ threadId, recordId })` or
`ThreadStore.getRunInput({ threadId, runId })`. The latter returns the original user input,
excluding joined inputs, and rejects ambiguous original inputs. Both return an optional canonical
envelope and require only `ThreadReader`. Authorize the owner and locator before reading and
verify the returned payload; absence alone does not prove an admission was never accepted.

Native stores provide `readIdentity({ threadId })` for the first canonical record and exact worker
origin/lineage records with their captured tail and producer epoch. It is one bounded, consistent
read, not an authorization grant. Custom ThreadStore adapters must implement this operation;
deploy matching Cloudflare client and owner packages for its read-only port protocol.

Use the existing `submissionInputRecordId` / `submissionSettlementRecordId` exports from
`@yielded/agent/submission-ledger`, or these `@yielded/agent/run-journal` locators:

- `workerInputRecordId(messageId)` and `firstWorkerInputRecordId(worker)` for source reservations,
  including before child admission and after retirement;
- `workerOriginRecordId(threadId)` for child origin;
- `workerReportRecordId(destinationIdempotencyKey)` and `peerMessageRecordId(messageId)`;
- `agentUpdateRecordId(threadId, runId, updateId)`, an Effect requiring `Crypto`.

Worker start and follow-up admission use first-record/exact identity reads and an indexed
snapshot of existing worker reservation/accounting families, with the full canonical tail
for the existing CAS. Lifetime limits still count completed reservations. Peer admission uses
an indexed lifetime count and exact message/accepted-input records; replies use the original
envelope's delivery principal.

`MessageDelivery.readPending({ ownerThreadId, limit })` reads current retained deliveries
through the existing owner-scoped `list` with `pendingOnly: true`, separately from canonical operations. It includes accepted,
parked, and future-due entries; processed/refused history is excluded. Cloudflare routes this
read to the source owner. Bounds, missing capability, malformed data, or a mismatched owner
fail closed. A no-receipt action delivery remains uncertain even before a canonical worker
reservation exists. A native receipt proves accepted admission, not destination materialization;
worker admission reserves its source input before returning a receipt. Applications can leave
accepted worker discovery to canonical worker inputs and recognize native completion/update
reports without reconstructing transport validation. These reads grant no execution authority.

Aborting a submission retains its unknown outcomes. A terminal settlement does not authorize
retrying or resolving those operations. Current SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Cloudflare thread stores
accept only fresh storage or format 15. Earlier beta formats fail before mutation; use a fresh
store for this release.

<a id="obligation-monitoring"></a>

## Monitor unfinished work

`scanObligations` scans current ledger state. It returns `submissionId`, `threadId`, state,
age, severity, and one of these blockers: `unknown`, `approval`, `waitingForChild`, `ready-aged`,
or `running-aged`.

Run the scan from cron, an alarm, or your monitoring service. Alert on every unknown outcome,
every overdue row, and a growing approval backlog. The framework starts no monitoring daemon and
sends no alerts.

## Abort unknown work

After authorization, abort a submission with:

```ts twoslash
import { AbortCommand } from "@yielded/agent/submission-ledger";
import { DurableAgentRuntime } from "@yielded/agent/durable-agent-runtime";
import { Effect } from "effect";

const abortSubmission = Effect.fn("abortSubmission")(function* (command: AbortCommand) {
  const runtime = yield* DurableAgentRuntime;
  return yield* runtime.abort(command);
});
```

Create the command with `AbortCommand.make({ submissionId, author, reason })`.
On Cloudflare, obtain `client` from `yield* CloudflareThreadClient`, then call
`client.abort(receipt.threadId, command)`.
The runtime checks authorization before reading or mutating the target.

Recovery claims the unknown Submission with its abort intent, handles attached children, and
records an aborted settlement. It does not replay uncertain ordinary tools.
The unknown evidence and first abort audit remain. Abort cannot roll back an external effect. A
`SettlementConflict` reports a terminal result that won before the abort.

Do not edit ledger state, wake the lane in a loop, resolve every open call separately, or clean up
children by hand. The runtime owns those steps after it durably accepts the parent abort. It never
chooses parent abort merely because a child is unknown. The host makes that decision.

There is no automatic inactivity timeout. A parked unknown Submission stays quiet while later
input in the same Thread can run. Approval, joining, and joined states retain their ordering
barriers. Authorized resolution or abort restores maintenance for the parked work; a live owner
still prevents another claim in that Thread.

<a id="observe-a-submission-outcome"></a>

## Observe an outcome

Persist the admission `Receipt`. Its submission, receipt, thread, and queue identifiers
remain stable across retries and replacement attempts.

`awaitSettlement` authorizes the receipt's thread and submission before lookup. A receipt
that mixes identifiers fails as `OperationDenied`. Authorization lasts for one wait. To enforce
revocation, interrupt the wait and start another. Interrupting a wait does not abort work.

| Need                      | API or record                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| admitted or queued        | `SubmissionLedger.lookup` returns `admitted` or `ready`                               |
| execution stage           | lookup returns `running` or `input-applied`                                           |
| suspension or joined host | `loadRecoverySnapshot` returns suspension and host linkage                            |
| unknown outcome           | lookup returns `unknown`; `explain` adds calls, audits, resolutions, and abort intent |
| terminal outcome          | `awaitSettlement(receipt)` returns the durable settlement                             |
| budget or stop detail     | `SubmissionSettled` records `finishReason`, `exhausted`, and `policyLimit`            |

Use `runtime.observe(receipt, { after })` for live progress. Filter the thread
stream by submission or run identifier. Joined input shares its host run, while its own terminal
record keeps the original submission identifier.

```ts
import { DurableAgentRuntime, type Receipt } from "@yielded/agent/durable-agent-runtime";
import { type ObservationOffset } from "@yielded/agent/records";
import { Effect, Stream } from "effect";

const observeOutcome = (receipt: Receipt, after?: ObservationOffset) =>
  Stream.unwrap(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const runtime = yield* DurableAgentRuntime;
      return runtime.observe(receipt, { after }).pipe(
        Stream.filter(
          ({ record }) =>
            record.payload._tag === "SubmissionSettled" &&
            record.payload.submissionId === receipt.submissionId,
        ),
        Stream.take(1),
      );
    }),
  );
```

On Cloudflare, read bounded pages with `readPage`, save the last sequence, and call
`awaitProgress` after an empty page. Avoid `readAll` and repeated `explain` calls in polling code.
Keep reads incremental and retain only the application's projection.

The public Cloudflare client cannot read the complete local recovery snapshot or scan all
nonterminal rows. If an external Worker needs suspension, FIFO blocker, input marker, or child
references, add an authorized Schema-backed read-only RPC to the owning Thread Object. Use
its local ledger and recovery snapshot. Do not copy the recovery classifier into the Worker.

Persist observation cursors and make downstream projection or delivery idempotent. A crash after
an external side effect can redeliver the record. Streams, notifications, callbacks, and process
finalizers provide no exactly-once delivery guarantee.

<a id="backup-and-restore-on-dn"></a>

## Back up and restore on Node.js

Use a file-consistent SQLite snapshot. Copy the database, WAL, and SHM files while no process owns
the database, or use `VACUUM INTO` or SQLite's online backup API. The supported `DN` shape has one
process owner per database file.
With an automatically managed host, run online backup through its shared connection; another
connection cannot read the live database. Stop the host before using an external backup tool.

A restore has four rules:

1. Pre-backup history must pass the same `verify` checks as the original.
2. Fence or terminate every producer from the original timeline before serving restored data.
   Restored storage rejects post-backup ownership tokens.
3. Treat external effects recorded only after the backup as unknown. Never replay them
   automatically. Resolve them through `resolveUnknown` using supplier records.
4. Receipts issued after the backup are gone. Clients must resubmit with idempotency keys. Reconcile
   any external effects from those lost submissions.

<a id="point-in-time-recovery-on-dc-manual-runbook"></a>

## Restore Cloudflare to an earlier point

SQLite-backed Durable Objects provide [30-day point-in-time recovery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#pitr-point-in-time-recovery-api) through
`getCurrentBookmark`, `getBookmarkForTime`, and `onNextSessionRestoreBookmark`. Miniflare does not
implement these APIs, so follow this hosted runbook:

1. stop admission for affected threads and let current alarms drain;
2. obtain the desired bookmark;
3. call `onNextSessionRestoreBookmark(bookmark)` inside the Object, then `ctx.abort()`;
4. apply the four restore rules above, including unknown external effects and lost receipts;
5. run `verifyEncoded` and `obligationsEncoded` before reopening admission.

Cross-Object children created after the bookmark need parent recovery. A restored Object replaces
old local producer epochs automatically.

## Authorization and isolation

Put each runtime storage domain behind authenticated ingress. Yielded Agent provides no tenant
authentication or row-level tenant isolation. Receipts, IDs, principal strings, and audit authors
identify records. They grant no access.

### Storage and addressing

Schedule and subscription owners are tenant-qualified. Ordinary thread requests and records
have no tenant field. A different principal does not create a separate thread log.

- On Node, bind each tenant to its own SQLite database or enforce application isolation on every
  read, write, scan, worker, and administration path.
- On Cloudflare, derive tenant-qualified Thread Object addresses in trusted Worker code.
  `CloudflareThreadClient` does not infer or authorize a tenant from a thread ID.

Keep tenant addressing stable across admission, history, children, schedules, subscriptions,
exports, backups, and operator access. Always check that a submission belongs to its selected
thread.

### Authorize each operation

| Operation                       | Host responsibility                                                     | Framework boundary                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| admission and prepared delivery | authenticate ingress, derive principal, authorize agent and destination | Schema validation and idempotency grant no access; authorizer is not an admission hook |
| reads and observation           | authorize the thread and submission before returning data               | runtime observation and waits consult the authorizer; direct store reads do not        |
| abort and resolution            | authorize the decision and supply trusted audit fields                  | runtime checks authorization before target I/O                                         |
| administration and scans        | restrict operators to the selected storage domain                       | default authorizer allows all; scans have no automatic tenant filter                   |

`possessionOperationAuthorizer` allows every request. Use it only behind a trusted host. Install
`operationAuthorizerLayer` when constructing the durable runtime. The runtime captures the policy
at Layer acquisition, so a Layer around a later method call cannot replace it.

Authenticate callers before invoking runtime methods. Some operation requests carry no principal,
and audit fields provide no authorization. Keep raw stores, ledgers, runtime services, and Durable
Object RPCs away from untrusted callers.

### Tools, delegation, and external resources

Use [`RunToolAuthorization`](/guide/tools/#authorize-tool-calls) to check proposed tool calls.
`OperationAuthorizer` protects the runtime operations listed above; the host authorizes admission.
Recheck policy after durable suspension. Approval applies to one exact action and expires. Parent
approval does not authorize child actions.

Delegation grants are immutable ceilings. Each child action must satisfy current policy, its grant,
target requirements, and resource scope. Model parameters cannot supply bindings, secrets,
identity, or policy. Validate and bound child output before use.

Keep secrets as handles. Redact diagnostics before storage or export. Generated code needs an
isolated executor with host tools behind the validated broker. Local sandbox processes have no
isolation. Exact-host browser checks do not provide connection-time network isolation. Enforce
read-only SQL through database permissions and host tenant scope.

## Scheduled input

`Scheduling` delivers encoded agent input through durable admission. A due occurrence remains its
obligation until it records a Receipt or proves permanent refusal. The host provides
`ScheduleAuthorizer` and owner-scoped management. Keep `ScheduleDriver` and `ScheduleStore` inside
the privileged host.

Preparation freezes the authorized envelope and advances the cursor atomically. Recover pending
delivery before preparing another occurrence. A lost admission reply retries the same envelope and
idempotency key. Transient or ambiguous failure stays pending. Automatic delivery retries stop after
`maxAutomaticAttempts` (default 8); parked work retains its envelope and receipt uncertainty.
`Scheduling.recover` re-arms that same identity, including after cancellation. Recovery advances an
attempt generation (pass the observed `pending.retry.generation` to `recover`), so a stale failed attempt cannot spend the new retry allowance. A late valid
Receipt can still complete the original obligation. Permanent refusal requires proof
that admission did not occur and the unchanged request cannot succeed.

Recurring downtime coalesces to the latest due firing. Pause and cancel stop new preparation while
pending delivery continues. Cancel is irreversible. Revocation blocks future preparation but must
finish already authorized envelopes. Resuming a paused schedule skips missed recurring times.

Use `{ _tag: "Interval", everyMillis: 60_000 }` for an interval, or
`{ _tag: "Cron", expression: "0 9 * * *", timeZone: "America/New_York" }` for an explicit IANA
cron zone. Cron without a zone keeps its existing UTC default; no host-local zone is inferred.

Quotas count pending delivery plus active or paused cursors. Terminal records retain replay
evidence without using capacity when no delivery remains. Schedule IDs and creation evidence are
never recycled. One corrupt due record cannot block later records; retry a failed sweep after the
recovery poll.

Node runs one Scope-owned indexed polling driver. Cloudflare commits schedule changes and alarms
together, pre-arms recovery before admission, and fences alarm acknowledgements by generation.
Storage failure that prevents alarm repair needs a later wake or operator action after storage
recovers.

See the compiling [Node](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/blob/main/packages/platform-node/test/fixtures/scheduling-example.ts)
and [Cloudflare](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/blob/main/packages/platform-cloudflare/examples/scheduling.ts)
examples.

## Event subscriptions

Subscriptions retain normalized events, select matching registrations, prepare agent input, and
deliver through durable admission. `EventAcknowledgement` confirms retained intake. A `Receipt`
confirms admission. No run or waiter stays open to watch the source.

Set `expiresAtMillis: null` for no time-based expiry; a once subscription is still consumed by
selection, and cancellation remains explicit. Finite deadlines keep their existing maximum-lifetime
validation. Pausing does not erase selected delivery evidence.

Without an explicit retention policy, records remain for the partition lifetime. Set
`SubscriptionLimits.retention` to bound completed event payloads and deliveries. Intake then
requires a stable authenticated `occurredAtMillis` from the source adapter and rejects fresh
identities outside `replayHorizonMillis`. This horizon is fixed for the partition once used.
Completed work becomes a compact deduplication tombstone until that horizon ends; duplicate intake
cannot reopen routing. `completedRetentionMillis` controls completed payload retention and
`maxTombstones` bounds deduplication storage. Backpressure remains explicit if live evidence or
in-horizon tombstones fill capacity. Idle native maintenance expires old tombstones.

Selected, prepared, parked, recovery-related and admitted-but-unsettled evidence is protected.
Node and Cloudflare admission adapters use the runtime's canonical `submissionStatus`. Enabling
retention with a custom `PreparedInputAdmission` requires that observation capability. An
unavailable probe is logged and retried without releasing evidence. Reconciliation of a payload
already reclaimed reports `event-reclaimed` rather than inventing a new delivery.

Each maintenance pass examines at most `batchSize` event candidates and `batchSize` delivery
candidates, plus one referenced event per delivery. Indexed relationship checks protect recovery
and unsettled work. Independent durable cursors advance past corrupt or protected candidates;
corrupt evidence is preserved and reported. Idle maintenance rearms while retained events remain.
The in-memory adapter copies its bounded maps/indexes, but does not decode the whole partition.

`EventSource.occurredAtMillis` must derive a stable timestamp from authenticated source facts.
Do not substitute intake time or generate a new timestamp on replay. Exact retained identities
replay before current horizon/capacity checks, including their timestamp and payload digest.
Expired pruned identities are rejected by the fixed horizon. Omit retention when the source
cannot supply trusted occurrence time; there is no undated-event pruning exception.

Each event and registration belongs to one stable `SourcePartition` with a tenant ID and source
address. Keep the address unchanged across deployments and source versions. There is no
cross-partition transaction or global subscription directory.

Use `makeEventSource` and `EventSources` for versioned event schemas, identity, matching, and
optional reconciliation. Use `makeSubscriptionInputBinding` and `SubscriptionInputBindings` for
destination preparation. Their callbacks and Schema codecs receive a fresh Scope per operation,
so acquired resources finalize when that operation completes, fails, or is interrupted. Other
service dependencies are captured at host assembly. Keep old source versions and bindings installed while retained work
needs them. Missing or ambiguous bindings leave selected delivery pending as
`unsupported-binding`. Persisted records contain no callbacks, Schemas, Effects, credentials, or
captured services.

`SubscriptionAuthorizer` covers management, intake, reconciliation, and preparation. Recovery has
its own `reconcile` decision. Keep stores, intake, and drivers out of model tool environments.
Restricted tools must bind owner, agent, principal, source catalog, and thread in the host.
A host may also permit a deterministic fresh thread for each selected event.

Use `getSubscription` to inspect the current revision, state, and configuration fingerprint.
`updateSubscription`, `pauseSubscription`, `resumeSubscription`, and `recoverSubscription` require
the expected `configurationRevision`. `cancelSubscription` also accepts an optional expected
revision. Revision conflicts expose the current revision/state; inspect the fingerprint after a
lost management reply to determine whether the intended configuration won. Creation replay always
compares the original request fingerprint, even after edits.

Every configuration/control revision advances the registration's eligibility ordinal. It can select
only events accepted after that revision. Events accepted earlier but not yet selected do not gain
eligibility under the new configuration, including changed matching keys. Selected deliveries retain
their captured configuration; pausing stops new selection while selected delivery continues.
Cancellation and captured expiry can refuse unprepared work. Prepared envelopes remain unchanged.
An uncertain ordinary tool is never replayed automatically.

Source recovery completions carry the captured registration revision. Pause preserves its recovery
intent, resume restores polling, and callbacks from an older revision cannot overwrite a new one.
Recovery reads share the per-item timeout and failure boundary. An unreadable record is reported
without guessing its revision or blocking routing, delivery, and maintenance for other records.
`recoverSubscription` re-arms source reconciliation where the configured source supports it;
`recoverDelivery(scope, key, expectedGeneration)` re-arms an individual parked delivery without
changing its identity or envelope. Repeating the same recovery generation is an idempotent no-op.

Intake deduplicates by tenant, source address, and logical event ID. Conflicting payload or source
version fails. Each event records a registration cutoff. Duplicate intake cannot move that cutoff
or reopen routing. Selection atomically advances the cursor, creates delivery obligations, and
consumes once registrations. Continuous subscriptions retain each event separately. Thread
admission order decides execution order.

Preparation rechecks authority, validates input, and freezes destination, principal, digests,
authorization metadata, and admission key. Cancellation, expiry, or revocation blocks new
preparation. Already prepared envelopes continue unchanged. Expiry never sends agent input.

Lost admission replies retry the exact envelope and key. After `maxAutomaticAttempts` (default 8),
delivery parks until `recoverDelivery` explicitly re-arms it. Cancellation never erases a prepared
uncertain envelope. Capacity waits spend the same automatic retry allowance; hosts should size it
for expected job duration and explicitly recover parked work. Event routing and source recovery
use their existing bounded sweeps and retry deadlines; settlement probes retry conservatively.
The delivery attempt cap does not cap all background maintenance.

Optional `admissionGroup` permits one actually unsettled submission per group **in a destination
thread**. Admission, suspension, unknown outcome and terminalization all retain occupancy until
canonical settlement finalization. A lagging finalization conservatively holds capacity until repair.
`FreshThread` per event does not provide exclusion across threads. Schedules retain one frozen
pending occurrence and coalesce missed recurring times; distinct events keep separate durable
obligations and produce explicit backpressure when backlog capacity is exhausted.

`admissionFence` captures bounded `{ policyId, key, revision }` coordinates. Install
`SubmissionAdmissionFence` when acquiring the destination ledger. Exact retained requests replay
before policy and occupancy checks; changed input, group or fence conflicts. Fresh admission checks
policy in the **same local transaction** as the ledger insert. SQL hosts must read policy through
that transaction's SqlClient, and all policy writers must share its authority. Remote policy reads
cannot fence remote mutations. Memory executes the bounded callback synchronously inside its
atomic mutation; an asynchronous callback fails closed as unavailable and is interrupted. Do not
fork, reenter admission, or retain transaction resources in the callback.

`AdmissionPolicyError.reason` distinguishes `refused` (conclusive stale/unsupported policy),
`unavailable` (retry without assuming nonadmission), and `occupied` (group capacity). Uninterpreted
fences fail closed. Ingress authorization is still required for replays. Put no secrets in fence
coordinates or error codes. Public status excludes payloads, parameters, context and credentials.
Execution remains at least once; provider failures never invent event completion.

### Partition-owned ancillary alarms

Cloudflare hosts can install `SubscriptionPartitionAlarmExtension` with handlers built by
`makeSubscriptionPartitionAlarmHandler`. Each handler owns one non-framework tag, a payload
Schema and a bounded timeout (at most 30 seconds). The factory captures host services but defers
`Subscriptions`, `SubscriptionIntake` and `SubscriptionDriver` requirements, including those in
payload decoders, until invocation. `makeSubscriptionPartitionObjectClass` supplies these native
services from the addressed partition after building the host Layer. Keep their lookup inside the
callback or decoder; yielding them while building the host Layer still requires them at assembly.
Handlers retain only their required native services in `R`; host requirements remain on the factory
Effect. Even if native services were present at assembly, the invocation uses its own instances.

An existing `handle: () => runtime.process` can therefore keep `SubscriptionIntake` in the process
Effect's requirements. Map its expected failures to `SubscriptionAlarmExtensionError`; no extra
handler argument or client Layer is needed. See the compiling Cloudflare example below for a
handler that accepts an event through native intake.

Each codec/callback invocation owns a fresh Scope. Invocation cleanup runs on success, typed failure,
defect, timeout and interruption; captured host services keep their host lifetime.

The native multiplexer processes at most 16 alarms per invocation and durably retries failed rows
independently, so a failed or unknown extension cannot block the subscription driver. Installing
handlers reserves eight minutes of the twelve-minute invocation budget for ancillary work; native
driver limits must fit the remaining four minutes. Unknown,
ambiguous, malformed and reserved `@yielded/agent/` tags fail closed and are reported. A replacement
alarm survives acknowledgement of its earlier version. The host owns external-effect idempotency,
uncertainty, payloads and transactional prearming; this extension defines no provider scheduler.

### Adopting these contracts

SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Cloudflare Thread adapters accept fresh storage or exactly format 15.
Earlier Thread formats fail acquisition without mutation; this release provides no Thread migration.
Preserve old stores and their compatible writer for retained work or inspection, and use fresh storage
for this release. The same format requirement applies to combined SQLite files used by Schedule
and Subscription adapters.

Cloudflare's separate Schedule and Subscription stores still upgrade supported version 2 layouts to
version 3. Each upgrade runs in one native transaction and advances its version marker last;
interruption retries the uncommitted upgrade. Unsupported layouts or invalid retained values fail
without committing a partial conversion. Preserve the original store if an upgrade fails.

For these upgrades, subscription configurations become revision 1 and remain pinned for already
selected deliveries. Retained retry counts become the initial generation's automatic attempt count.
Existing runnable work stays runnable; its next failure applies the current retry cap. No admission
group or fence is inferred. Missing historical occurrence and settlement timestamps remain absent;
replay returns the retained event and receipt, and retention keeps history of unknown age.

Application projection checkpoints may omit compatibility metadata; consumers must validate their
state with Schema. Runtime recovery checkpoints retain and check their metadata, and incompatible
cache state falls back to canonical history. `verifyOnOpen` audits canonical history and application
projection checkpoints; recovery caches are validated when loaded. See
[recovery checkpoints](/concepts/durability/#recovery-checkpoints).

Keep the source versions and input bindings needed to finish retained deliveries. Register the
current binding for each stable Agent ID; unfinished operations retain their original replay
contracts. See [deployment continuity](/guide/agents/#resume-across-deployments). Custom stores must
implement revision and retry-generation fencing, bounded retention cursors, and canonical observation.

Node uses a Scope-owned polling driver. Cloudflare commits work and required alarms together and
re-arms after failed passes. If storage prevents mutation and alarm repair, restore storage and send
a new wake or intervene as an operator.

See the compiling [Node](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/blob/main/packages/platform-node/test/fixtures/subscriptions-example.ts)
and [Cloudflare](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/blob/main/packages/platform-cloudflare/examples/subscriptions.ts)
examples.

### GitHub workflow run completion

Import GitHub integration from `@yielded/agent/git-hub-workflow-source`.
`makeGitHubWorkflowRunSource` watches one repository, run ID, attempt, and expected head SHA. It
reports successful and unsuccessful completion. It does not aggregate every check for a commit.

`acceptVerifiedGitHubWorkflowRunWebhook` verifies raw bytes before parsing a completed
`workflow_run` event. Webhook and exact-attempt API observations normalize to one completion
identity. A webhook delivery ID alone cannot deduplicate them.

Registration arms reconciliation before provider reads. An already completed attempt can notify a
new watch without a check-then-subscribe race. Cancellation, expiry, and once selection stop
provider polling. GitHub does not automatically redeliver failed webhooks, so reconciliation checks
the registered attempt while it remains retained, readable, and authorized. It does not provide
general historical replay.

## Retained message delivery

When composing additional SQLite adapters with a Node host, provide the host Layer to the adapter.
The host exposes its `SqlClient`, `SqliteStorageConfig`, and `SqliteStorageFailpoint` so subscriptions
and runtime operations share one serialized connection, including during startup recovery.

`MessageDeliveryStore` retains a host-prepared input independently of either Thread's current Run.
`pending` means the obligation is saved; an accepted Receipt parks the delivery as
`awaiting-settlement`, with no status-poll deadline. `processed` means that exact Receipt has a
terminal Settlement. Native workers and peer inputs acknowledge their source before finalizing
the destination ledger. A lost acknowledgement is replayed from canonical settlement during
recovery. A lost admission reply
reuses the frozen envelope and admission key. It cannot create a replacement input.

Node hosts run a scoped, bounded polling loop over the delivery deadline index. Cloudflare Thread
Objects prearm their maintenance generation before message writes, retain the earliest alarm,
and run one bounded delivery wave beside source work. Both paths recover without wake hints,
including after the source and destination Runs settle. Interrupting a host releases live
resources while retaining the obligation for recovery.

Automatic retry has finite attempt and deadline bounds. `refused` and `parked` remain inspectable;
an explicit driver `retry` renews a parked obligation's deadline without changing its envelope.
Generic host-prepared inputs without native source provenance remain dormant until the host
supplies an exact `Complete` acknowledgement or explicitly retries the retained Receipt once.
Completed rows retain
deduplication evidence and count toward the retention limit; capacity exhaustion fails explicitly.

These are trusted host ports. Authenticate the sender, authorize routing and encode the
