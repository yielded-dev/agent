title: Durable background subagents
description: Give the parent background tools and send worker findings back as new input.
---

<a id="durable-background-subagents"></a>

Give the parent tools to start and steer a researcher while it keeps chatting:

```ts twoslash
import { Subagent } from "@yielded/agent";

import { Researcher } from "./researcher.ts";

const background = Subagent.background(Researcher, {
  start: true,
  followUp: true,
  reportToParent: true,
});
```

A start returns `{ worker, delivery }`. The delivery's message reference identifies the retained
input; its receipt appears after destination acceptance. A `pending` delivery is queued for
delivery and says nothing about child execution. The parent keeps responding, and a
`WorkerCompletion` message arrives when the child run ends. It contains the projected result
or a bounded failure, the worker and run identities, and a budget-exhaustion flag. Finishing
or aborting the parent run leaves the worker and pending report running.

Reports join an active parent run at an input boundary or start a later run in the same thread.
The framework delivers them separately from the parent's application input: no report tags,
mapper, input union, or extra host registration is required. Existing callers must opt in.

## Retain one assignment

Opt a worker definition into assignment completion through its typed output:

```ts twoslash
import { Agent, Worker } from "@yielded/agent";
import { Schema } from "effect";
import { Toolkit } from "effect/ai";

const Task = Agent.make("task", {
  input: Schema.String,
  output: Schema.Struct({ status: Worker.AssignmentDisposition, answer: Schema.String }),
  instructions: "Use waiting when you need an answer; completed only when the assignment is done.",
  toolkit: Toolkit.empty,
  runDisposition: {
    workerLifecycle: "assignment",
    schema: Worker.AssignmentDisposition,
    fromOutput: (output) => output.status,
  },
});
```

Start and steer `Task` through the same background APIs. A `waiting` result ends that run and
keeps the assignment steerable. A `completed` result permanently seals the assignment only after
its latest accepted instructions have been applied. Failed or exhausted runs also seal it.
Inspect the worker's `state` to distinguish assignment completion from a completed run.
The choice is retained at worker creation; existing workers and definitions without this opt-in
remain reusable. See the [terminal contract](/reference/subagents/#terminal-assignments).

## Send intermediate findings

Declare the update Schema on the Agent once, then enable parent reporting:

```ts twoslash title="background-updates.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/background-updates.ts"

```

Save as `background-updates.ts`. This example reviews source notes supplied in its input; add your
research tools to its toolkit for live retrieval. The native `emit_update` tool accepts
`{ value: AreaConcern }`. Its acknowledgement retains the finding and lets the child continue.
An update is provisional information, independent of the final hotel result.

Give a coordinator `hotels.toolkit` and provide `hotels.layer`. Register the exact
`HotelResearcher` definition alongside that coordinator, using the host setup below.
With `reportToParent: true`, the parent receives both `WorkerUpdate` and `WorkerCompletion`
without an application input union, mapper, or `reporting` entry. Agents without `updates`
continue to send only completion.

The parent consumes the finding at a safe input boundary or in a later run. It can explain the
concern, ask the user how to proceed, and use follow-up tools to redirect the hotel worker and
other workers to Rosebank. Emission does not wait for a user decision or stop the child.
See [update delivery guarantees](/reference/subagents/#update-delivery-guarantees) for ordering,
backpressure, and recovery.

## Give the parent its tools

```ts twoslash title="background-coordinator.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/background-coordinator.ts"

```

Save as `background-coordinator.ts`. This uses the
[activity researcher](/guide/subagents/in-memory-attached/#define-the-child) directly.
The default result is `{ output, budgetExhausted }`. Use an explicit `Subagent.make` declaration
when the parent should receive a [custom result projection](/reference/subagents/#input-and-result-mappings).

### Define the parent's input

```ts twoslash title="background-input.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/background-input.ts"

```

Save as `background-input.ts`. Instructions and host policy keep the original admitted
application input as their context. For a completion, the framework renders the typed message
instead of calling the application's `inputPrompt` again.

<a id="connect-both-agents-to-a-durable-host"></a>

## Connect the host

```ts twoslash title="background-host.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/background-host.ts"

```

Save as `background-host.ts`. Each entry registers an agent and its code versions with the host.
The host discovers reporting from the coordinator's background tools.
The Layers supply tool handlers, provider credentials, and worker access.

The host recovers accepted work and pending reports after restarts. Keep report preparation
free of external side effects: recovery may repeat it before its decision is recorded.
Conclusive refusal before destination admission closes the retained source input and releases
its capacity without a destination receipt or acknowledgement. Ambiguous delivery remains owed.

### Authorize the conversation

```ts twoslash title="background-access.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/background-access.ts"

```

Save as `background-access.ts`. Worker access denies by default; this local example permits
one user and conversation. In an application, check authenticated identity and thread ownership.

## Run it

```ts twoslash title="background-main.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/background-main.ts"

```

Save as `background-main.ts` and run with `node --experimental-transform-types background-main.ts`.
Use the [Node.js setup](/platforms/node/#start-the-host) to submit
`BackgroundCoordinator` with the exported `principal`, `threadId`, and this input:

```json
{ "text": "Find food and walking activities in Lisbon." }
```

Keep the host running so research and report delivery can progress. The
[Cloudflare runtime](/platforms/cloudflare/) supports the same contracts.

## Follow up and cancel

A follow-up returns its retained delivery state and joins an active worker run at a safe input
boundary or starts a later run. Keep the returned message reference: inspect that delivery or wait
for a report instead of sending the command again. Opt in to `inspect`, `list`, or `cancel` tools
when needed. Inspection accepts a message reference for delivery state or a receipt for a saved
result. Cancellation targets one input's receipt; it does not close the worker. Application code can
permanently seal the worker with `Subagent.stop` and a stable command key. See the
[control contract](/reference/subagents/#background-delivery-and-recovery) for stop and input
application facts.
Several inputs joining one run produce one logical report.
An input cancelled before it starts a run produces no completion message.

Workers share a bounded allocation from their source by default. Host lifetime and concurrency
limits still apply. See [independent budgets](/reference/subagents/#independently-fund-background-runs)
for separately funded work.
