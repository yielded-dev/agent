description: Let an agent run one bounded JavaScript program through an explicit tool allowlist.

<a id="code-mode"></a>

Code Mode gives an agent one Effect AI Tool for a small JavaScript program. The program can call a
fixed set of application Tools through named globals, then return one JSON value. It fits questions
that need authorized reads and writes, overlapping independent I/O, and a compact answer.

For example, an invoice analyst can answer a question this way:

```ts
const code = `async () => {
  const result = await warehouse.query({
    sql: "SELECT region, SUM(revenue) AS total FROM invoice_summary GROUP BY region",
  });
  return result.rows.sort((a, b) => Number(b.total) - Number(a.total))[0];
}`;
```

`warehouse` is not a database client. It is a generated global that routes through the runtime's
Tool broker to an application-owned Tool handler. The handler decides which resources the program may read or change.

## Build an analyst

In your Yielded Agent application, add the Cloudflare executor:

```sh
bun add @yielded/agent-platform-cloudflare@beta effect
```

Keep framework packages at the [same release](/guide/getting-started/#installation-and-compatibility).

This smaller example uses fixed invoice rows so the complete Tool and handler are visible.
Generated code calls `warehouse.invoices({ region: "emea" })` and computes its answer from those
rows. The linked warehouse example replaces the fixed data with a brokered SQL query.

```ts twoslash
import { OpenAiClient, OpenAiLanguageModel } from "@effect/ai-openai";
// @types: @cloudflare/workers-types
import { InMemory, CodeMode, Agent, AgentRuntime } from "@yielded/agent";
import { CloudflareCodeMode } from "@yielded/agent-platform-cloudflare/cloudflare-code-mode";
import { ToolExecutionClass } from "@yielded/agent/durable-step";
import { Effect, Layer, Redacted, Schema } from "effect";
import { WorkerEnvironment } from "effect-cf";
import { Tool, Toolkit } from "effect/ai";
import { FetchHttpClient } from "effect/http";

// In an application, Wrangler generates these binding types.
declare global {
  namespace Cloudflare {
    interface Env {
      readonly LOADER: WorkerLoader;
      readonly OPENAI_API_KEY: string;
    }
  }
}

const ListInvoices = Tool.make("list_invoices", {
  description: "Read invoice totals for a region: emea or americas.",
  parameters: Schema.Struct({ region: Schema.Literals(["emea", "americas"]) }),
  success: Schema.Array(Schema.Struct({ customer: Schema.String, revenue: Schema.Number })),
}).annotate(ToolExecutionClass, "readonly");

const InvoiceHandlers = Toolkit.make(ListInvoices).toLayer({
  list_invoices: ({ region }) =>
    Effect.succeed(
      [
        { customer: "Acme", region: "emea", revenue: 12_000 },
        { customer: "Atlas", region: "emea", revenue: 8_000 },
        { customer: "Beacon", region: "americas", revenue: 15_000 },
      ].filter((invoice) => invoice.region === region),
    ),
});

const codeMode = CodeMode.make("run_javascript", {
  description: "Read invoices, calculate the answer in JavaScript, and return a small JSON result.",
  tools: { warehouse: { invoices: ListInvoices } },
  maxEgressBytes: 8 * 1024,
});

const analyst = Agent.make("invoice-analyst", {
  input: Schema.String,
  output: Schema.Struct({ answer: Schema.String }),
  instructions: "Use run_javascript to calculate invoice answers. Return an answer as JSON.",
  toolkit: Toolkit.make(codeMode.tool),
  policy: {
    maxTurns: 3,
    maxToolCalls: 6,
    maxDuration: "45 seconds",
    // This sandbox example runs one generated program at a time.
    toolConcurrency: 1,
  },
});

const AnalystLive = Layer.unwrap(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const env = yield* WorkerEnvironment;
    const CodeModeLive = CloudflareCodeMode.layer(codeMode, {
      loader: env.LOADER,
      handlers: InvoiceHandlers,
    });
    const ModelLive = OpenAiLanguageModel.model("gpt-6-luna").pipe(
      Layer.provide(
        OpenAiClient.layer({ apiKey: Redacted.make(env.OPENAI_API_KEY) }).pipe(
          Layer.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer),
        ),
      ),
    );

    return Layer.mergeAll(CodeModeLive, ModelLive, InMemory.layer);
  }),
);

export const program = AgentRuntime.run(analyst, "What is the total invoice revenue in EMEA?").pipe(
  Effect.provide(AnalystLive),
  Effect.scoped,
);
```

Only the question is input to the agent. `AnalystLive` yields `WorkerEnvironment` to obtain the
loader and provider key, leaving that service visible in the composed `program`'s requirements.
An `effect-cf` Worker supplies it. The application owns the HTTP response and authentication.

`CodeMode.make` fixes the namespaces and methods visible to generated code. Include `codeMode.tool`
in the agent's Toolkit. `CloudflareCodeMode.layer` supplies the selected Tool handlers and executor
at construction, capturing the services used by inner calls. Handler construction errors and
remaining service requirements stay visible. The runtime supplies its own Tool broker.
For a custom executor, provide it and the selected handlers directly to `codeMode.handlers`.

Code Mode accepts read and mutation Tools without additional approval requirements. The broker
retains parameter and result schemas, visibility, inherited grants, host action-time authorization,
and run budgets. `RunToolAuthorization` receives each inner call with its `programmatic` parent
identity before reservation and execution. Approving the outer Tool does not authorize its inner calls. Already
authorized calls require no additional approval round trip; Tools declaring `needsApproval` remain
unsupported and fail closed. Enforce resource and tenant access inside handlers. For read-only
workloads, use a read-only database identity where available. The warehouse example's Durable Object uses an
application SQL allowlist because its SQLite authorizer blocks `PRAGMA query_only`. That scanner is
a demo boundary.

<a id="discovery"></a>

## Discover method documentation

For a large allowlist, set `includeDeclarations: false` to keep namespace inventories and full
declarations out of the initial tool description. Add `ToolDiscovery.make` beside the execution
tool. Discovery returns only matching, currently eligible methods and their encoded schemas.

```ts twoslash
import { Agent, CodeMode, ToolDiscovery } from "@yielded/agent";
import { ToolExecutionClass } from "@yielded/agent/durable-step";
import { Schema } from "effect";
import { Tool, Toolkit } from "effect/ai";

const ListInvoices = Tool.make("list_invoices", {
  description: "Read invoice amounts for a customer.",
  parameters: Schema.Struct({ customer: Schema.String }),
  success: Schema.Array(Schema.Struct({ amountCents: Schema.Int })),
}).annotate(ToolExecutionClass, "readonly");

export const codeMode = CodeMode.make("run_javascript", {
  description: "Use discovered methods to compute invoice answers in JavaScript.",
  includeDeclarations: false,
  tools: { billing: { invoices: ListInvoices } },
});
export const discovery = ToolDiscovery.make();

export const analyst = Agent.make("invoice-discovery", {
  input: Schema.String,
  output: Schema.Struct({ answer: Schema.String }),
  instructions: "Discover invoice methods, compute the answer, then return JSON.",
  toolkit: Toolkit.make(discovery.tool, codeMode.tool),
  toolExposure: { initialToolNames: [], maxTools: 8, maxSchemaBytes: 32_768 },
});

// Host-side selective TypeScript declarations; fails with CodeModeDescriptionError.
export const invoiceDeclarations = codeMode.describe(["billing.invoices"], { maxBytes: 8_192 });
```

Provide `discovery.handlers` alongside the existing Code Mode executor/handler Layer. A discovery
call with `{ query: "invoice", namespace: "billing" }` describes `billing.invoices` and selects
the owning `run_javascript` tool for the next turn. Generated code can then call
`await billing.invoices({ customer: "Acme" })`. Common native tools can remain pinned alongside
these two tools.

Each match has a distinct ID such as `code-mode:run_javascript:billing.invoices`, its native tool
name, namespace and method. This remains unambiguous when one Tool has several aliases or is also
registered natively. Selecting a Code Mode match exposes its outer execution tool; it does not
expand the construction-time allowlist. Inner broker calls do not change native exposure.

`describe` is a host API over that fixed allowlist, not a visibility-filtered model tool. It accepts
one to 64 unique exact method paths and defaults to 16 KiB of complete UTF-8 declarations, with a
256 KiB maximum. Invalid paths and excessive output fail with `CodeModeDescriptionError`.
Declarations and discovery results use the native encoded parameter/success schemas; provider
schema transformations do not change the sandbox wire contract. The full `declarations` string
remains available to the host even when omitted from the model description.

Use `discover_tools` for model-facing documentation subject to host visibility and inherited
grants. The runtime filters the sandbox's actual namespaces and methods as well, so generated code
cannot enumerate hidden methods. If grants or host policy hide an allowlisted method while
`includeDeclarations` is still true, the runtime refuses the configuration before its full
description can leak. Use generic shared descriptions and `includeDeclarations: false` for that
case. Default eager Code Mode behavior remains available when the full allowlist is eligible.
Approval, budget and handler authorization constraints continue to apply.

## Program results and limits

Each generated namespace method returns a Promise. The program must be one
async function expression, runs once with no arguments, and returns JSON. `console.log` output
returns with the result. Expected inner Tool failures reject the Promise with a JSON failure
envelope, which generated code can catch and handle. Invalid inner arguments are rejected by the
broker before their handler starts. Invalid arguments to the outer Code Mode tool, such as an empty
`code` string, return a native `ToolParameterValidationError` result so the model can correct them
without starting the executor.

The Tool broker rejects calls outside the construction-time allowlist. Use `Promise.all` for
independent calls and `await` for actual dependencies:

```js
async () => {
  const project = await tools.createProject({ name: "Launch" });
  const tasks = await Promise.all(
    ["Design", "Build", "Ship"].map((title) => tools.createTask({ projectId: project.id, title })),
  );
  return { projectId: project.id, tasksCreated: tasks.length };
};
```

Set `limits.maxHostCallConcurrency` from 1 through 64 (default 4). Both the executor and broker
bound active calls; waiting calls stay in Effect structured concurrency. Independent results return
when ready, without waiting for earlier calls. `toolConcurrency` limits outer Tool Calls, so several
simultaneous Code Mode passes can each use their inner concurrency allowance. Set it to 1 when the
inner bound should also be the run's bound.

The executor enforces source, wall-clock, log, result, host-call, and per-host-call byte limits. Code Mode applies `maxEgressBytes` after optional redaction to the result, logs, and
thrown value visible to the model. The agent policy's `maxToolCalls` also includes brokered inner
calls. See [Budgets & bounded autonomy](/concepts/budgets/#programmatic-calls-and-code-mode).

The default executor limits include 30 seconds and 64 host calls. Supply a `CodeExecutionLimits`
value through `limits` when constructing Code Mode to change them; `maxWallTime` takes an Effect
`Duration`. An agent's smaller remaining budget still applies. `redactEgress` can transform the
result and logs before the aggregate model-visible byte limit.
Its required services remain in the Code Mode handler Layer's requirements and are captured when
that Layer is built. Temporary redactor resources close with each invocation. The redactor must
be total: defects and interruption retain their Effect semantics.

## Partial outcomes

Writes are not transactional. A rejected `Promise.all` ends the program and interrupts outstanding
calls; completed writes remain completed. Await every call the result depends on, and use
`Promise.allSettled` when independent failures should not stop the remaining work.

A `CodeModeFailure` includes invocation-ordered `calls` with `succeeded`, `failed`, `uncertain`, or
`not-started` status. A confirmed failure does not imply rollback. A started call without a confirmed
outcome is uncertain and must be reconciled with the application before retrying. Calls that cannot
fit the output budget are counted in `omittedCalls`; do not assume an omitted call never ran.
Evidence takes priority over logs and thrown values when the budget is tight.

Set `onPassExit` to receive the full ephemeral report after executor fibers and resources close,
including timeout, defect, and interruption. The host callback's Effect service requirements remain
visible in the handler Layer. Reports contain tool names and statuses, without copying arguments or
results. Existing programmatic Tool spans retain per-call timing and execution identity. No inner
Canonical Records or program checkpoints are created; a process loss also loses these local reports.

The outer Tool is always `uncertain` and `Tool.Readonly` is false. Under a durable host, an unresolved
program enters the ordinary unknown-outcome protocol; it is never automatically replayed, even if
its selected Tools happen to be readonly or idempotent. Recovery of a complete JavaScript program
requires separate checkpoint/resume semantics.

## Run generated code on Cloudflare

`@yielded/agent-platform-cloudflare` supplies `dynamicWorkerCodeExecutorLayer`. It loads each pass
into a fresh Cloudflare Dynamic Worker with `globalOutbound: null`. Generated code has no ambient
network, bindings, secrets, filesystem, or environment. Its only host authority is the scoped RPC
capability for allowlisted Tool calls.

Declare a Worker Loader binding in `wrangler.jsonc`. Cloudflare documents `worker_loaders` as the
binding that gives a Worker access to `env.LOADER`.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "warehouse-analyst",
  "main": "src/worker.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-05-01",
  "worker_loaders": [{ "binding": "LOADER" }],
}
```

`CloudflareCodeMode.layer` uses that resolved binding. The lower-level
`dynamicWorkerCodeExecutorLayer({ loader })` remains available for direct `CodeExecutor` access.

See Cloudflare's [Dynamic Workers guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/getting-started/)
for Worker Loader setup and loading modes. This adapter uses `load()` for a fresh pass.

Code Mode is ephemeral. The executor retains no pass state, and a later pass can run in another
isolate. It does not make an Agent durable, persist generated programs, reconnect a lost pass, or
replay an unresolved call. Use a Durable Object or another application store for data that must
outlive a request. A warehouse application can use a Durable Object for its invoice data.

## Application integration

Use the [canonical Cloudflare application](https://github.com/yielded-dev/agent/tree/main/examples/travel-planner)
for the repository's deployment setup. A Code Mode integration additionally needs a Worker Loader
binding and a bounded Tool allowlist. The broker prevents calls to unlisted Tools, but the
application's handlers still decide which tenant, table, account, or secret may be accessed.

## Related capabilities

[Sandbox execution](/guide/sandbox/) covers trusted local commands. Its local adapter is unisolated and
does not implement the `CodeExecutor` required here. [Browser tools](/guide/browser/) cover page capture,
crawl, and interactive passes. Tools with uncertain external effects still require application
resource authorization when exposed through Code Mode.
