<a id="certify-storage-adapters"></a>

`certifyDurableAdapters` tests a candidate `SubmissionLedger` and `ThreadStore` pair and
returns one schema-encoded report.

| Level                      | Evidence                                                                           |

| 3. Runtime loss            | Exercises process termination or eviction, or records the committed suites that do |

## Implement the store contract

A `ThreadStore` materializes a thread, appends fenced batches, reads or observes
records, exports history, and inspects the tail. Appends must be atomic, digest-bound, idempotent by
batch ID, checked against the expected tail, and fenced by producer epoch. Reads decode stored
values through schemas.

`ThreadStore.checkpoints` is optional storage for application projections. An adapter offering it
must run the generic checkpoint conformance suite. Retained-history execution does not use it.

A new `ThreadCheckpoint` needs only `schemaVersion`, `threadId`,
`throughSequence`, `tailDigest`, `state`, and `createdAt`. Adapters bind the sequence and digest
to a canonical batch tail; consumers decode `state` and decide whether its projection version
supports suffix replay. `ThreadProjection` retains version 2 and rejects older snapshots so
consumers can rebuild from canonical records.

The optional `engineVersion`, `agentDefinitionDigest`, `modelDigest`, and `toolDigest` fields are
deprecated for application projections; adapters retain them without interpreting them. Supplied
values remain validated and survive decoding and encoding, including historical checkpoint
load/save. SQLite and Cloudflare retain immutable byte comparisons for generic projection
checkpoints: changing or removing metadata from an existing checkpoint can conflict.

The separate optional `ThreadStore.recoveryCheckpoints` capability stores one latest recovery
snapshot per Thread. The runtime populates and compares all four metadata fields in this
slot; absent or incompatible metadata falls back to canonical replay.
`SaveRecoveryCheckpointRequest` carries the checkpoint and producer epoch.
In one transaction, validate epoch equality and the canonical batch tail sequence and digest,
then replace the cached value. An older snapshot must not replace a newer one; equal-tail
replacement permits repair. Keep generic projection checkpoints independent of this slot.

Decode stored recovery checkpoints and verify their canonical binding on load. Invalid cache data
returns `CheckpointRejected`; infrastructure failures remain `ThreadStoreError`. A lookup before
the latest checkpoint may return no checkpoint. The runtime validates its versioned continuation
state and falls back to canonical replay when the cache is absent or incompatible. Neither a
checkpoint nor an evidence index grants ownership or replaces canonical tool and Durable Step
evidence. See [recovery checkpoints](/concepts/durability/#recovery-checkpoints) for eligibility
and suffix bounds.

Test recovery checkpoint replacement, stale producers, corruption, absence, and reopen after failure,
interruption, and timeout. Persistent format upgrades must preserve supported stored data in one
transaction, advance the version marker last, and refuse unsupported or ambiguous layouts without
resetting them.

The supplied adapters and `ThreadExport` support 131,072 canonical records per Thread. Keep each
`ThreadRead` page at or below 1,024 records and each `CanonicalBatch` at or below 256. An export
must preserve one captured snapshot while paging its payload reads; it returns the full record
array and must not silently truncate history.

Implement `SubmissionLedger.readAbortIntent` as a strongly consistent read of one submission's
abort intent. The runtime polls this method during execution, so its work must stay independent
of other submissions, approvals, and attached children. Unknown submissions fail with `LedgerError`.
The read grants no ownership, and `canonicalRecordId` must come from canonical history.

```ts
import type { SubmissionId } from "@yielded/agent/identifiers";
import { AbortIntentRequest, SubmissionLedger } from "@yielded/agent/submission-ledger";
import { Effect } from "effect";

const readAbort = Effect.fn(function* (submissionId: SubmissionId) {
  const ledger = yield* SubmissionLedger;
  return yield* ledger.readAbortIntent(AbortIntentRequest.make({ submissionId }));
});
```

Cloudflare keeps this read local to the submission's owning Durable Object. The abort command
still becomes canonical under the append gate before the runtime interrupts execution.

## Run the certification

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { certifyDurableAdapters } from "@yielded/agent-testing/certification";

const certificate = Effect.gen(function* () {
  return yield* certifyDurableAdapters({
    adapter: { name: "@your-org/storage-yours" },
    submissionLedger: yourLedgerLayer,
    threadStore: yourStoreLayer,
    tierThreeEvidence: ["path/to/your/real-loss.test.ts"],
  });
});
```

Provide `Crypto.Crypto` with `NodeCrypto.layer` on Node or `BrowserCrypto.layer` in workerd. Run
with a `TestClock` through `@effect/vitest` or a manual `TestClock.layer()` root. Tier 1 advances
leases, and tier 2 advances past the ownership lease during recovery. Pass
`ownershipLeaseDuration` when the ledger uses a different lease.

If both ports share a connection, pass the same combined layer instance to both fields. Layer
memoization will acquire it once.

The returned `CertificationReport` includes adapter identity, the ledger durability claim, each
tier 1 result, each tier 2 cell, and tier 3 evidence. `ok` is true only when every executed check
passes. Statuses such as `not-triggered`, `recorded-evidence`, `not-exercised`, and
`not-applicable` describe scope. They count as neither a pass nor a failure.

Use `fullyCertified` when a gate requires complete durable-adapter certification in this run.
It requires `ok: true`, a durable adapter, and at least one passing real-loss case from `crashLever`.
All lever cases must belong to the `real-loss` suite. An empty lever reports `not-exercised`.

| Tier 3 status                              | `ok` when executed checks pass | `fullyCertified` |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `exercised` with passing real-loss cases   | `true`                         | `true`           |
| `recorded-evidence`                        | `true`                         | `false`          |
| `not-exercised`                            | `true`                         | `false`          |
| `not-applicable` for a non-durable adapter | `true`                         | `false`          |

Any failed executed check makes both fields `false`. Recorded citations are external evidence;
the runner does not execute or verify those suites. Non-durable adapters can pass conformance
without earning durable certification. Reports keep the `effect-agent/certification@2` format.

<a id="what-tier-2-asserts-exactly"></a>

## Interpret tier 2 results

Tier 2 first drives and verifies each of six scenarios without a fault, recording reached
coordinator locations. It then injects each reached failpoint into fresh thread state and
drives recovery through public operations. Locations observed during recovery also enter the
sweep. Each scenario/location pair is armed at most once. The runner resolves unknown outcomes
as `SafeToRetry` and approvals as `approved` only when `explainThread` authorizes that action.

Each cell reports:

- `converged` when the failpoint fired and recovery settled with verified invariants;
- `not-triggered` when the location did not fire, including locations that share the scenario's
  verified clean run because they were never reached;
- `failed` for any other result, with bounded diagnostic detail.

`not-triggered` records the tested scope. It makes no fault-survival claim. Every scenario/location
pair remains in the report; shared clean results are identified in their detail. A location absent
from both discovery and the documented never-fired set is armed in every scenario, so new
failpoints cannot silently disappear from the sweep. Repository tests pin the fired paths per
scenario and the exact never-fired set. Dedicated suites and crash matrices cover those operator, abort, compaction,
background-worker, and Agent-update paths.
Those dedicated suites run separately; the certificate runner does not execute them.

The final invariant check recomputes the digest chain from `EMPTY_TAIL_DIGEST` and uses the same
checker as the administrative `verify` operation.

<a id="tier-3-evidence"></a>

## Provide tier 3 evidence

- `@yielded/agent-storage-memory` reports `not-applicable` because it declares non-durable state.
- `@yielded/agent-storage-sqlite` records the platform Node process-kill suites.
- `@yielded/agent-storage-postgres` reports `not-exercised` because no committed process-kill
  suite drives it yet.
- `@yielded/agent-storage-cloudflare` records Durable Object eviction, cross-object subagent, and
  Miniflare restart suites.
- A third-party adapter may pass `crashLever` to kill or evict its runtime and reopen storage for
  selected rows. Successful rows report `exercised`. Without that lever or committed evidence, the
  report says `not-exercised`.

<a id="shipped-adapter-tests"></a>

Import `CertificationReport` and `certifyPorts` from
`@yielded/agent/testing/certification`. The shared conformance cases live in
`@yielded/agent/testing/thread-store-conformance` and
`@yielded/agent/testing/submission-ledger-conformance`. Production schemas, ports,
replay, verification, and runtime APIs have their own public thread modules.

<a id="subscription-stores"></a>

## Certify subscription stores

An adapter that implements `SubscriptionStore` must also run
`subscriptionStoreConformanceCases` from `@yielded/agent/testing/subscription-store-conformance`. Give each case a fresh
partition. The cases cover intake cutoffs, deduplication, once selection, capacity, cancellation,
prepared recovery, catch-up, scan cursors, and replay after limits tighten.

The thread and submission certificate does not include these cases. Add restart or eviction
tests around intake, partial fanout, selection, preparation, admission, and receipt persistence.
