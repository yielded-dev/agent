description: Declare a child agent, give its tool to a parent, and choose attached or background execution.

<a id="subagents"></a>

Give a parent agent a specialist it can call:

```ts twoslash title="subagent-basics.ts" src="snippets/travel-planner/subagent-basics.ts"

```

The parent calls `summarize` like any other tool. The child gets that call's input, runs with its
own instructions and conversation, and returns `{ output, budgetExhausted }`. Its intermediate
history stays out of the parent's context. Each agent can use its own model and toolkit.

`Subagent.layer(delegation)` requires a model: supply it with `Layer.provide(model)` or provide
it around the parent program. An [AutoModel](/reference/decision-models/#automodel) selects from
each new child's delegated task automatically. A shared selection store retains the child's
choice for follow-ups; sibling threads select independently.

This defines the agents. Choose how to run them below.

## Choose a setup

| Kind                                                       | Parent behavior                                              | Use it when                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [In-memory attached](/guide/subagents/in-memory-attached/) | Waits for a tool result; child shares its Scope              | Restarting the task after a process crash is acceptable        |
| [Durable attached](/guide/subagents/durable-attached/)     | Suspends, then resumes with the child's result               | The parent needs the answer and progress must survive restarts |
| [Durable background](/guide/subagents/background/)         | Continues; receives declared updates and a completion report | The user should keep chatting while work runs                  |

Both attached forms use `Summarize.tool`. Durable execution comes from the host you run them on.
For background work, expose start and follow-up tools instead:

```ts twoslash
import { Subagent } from "@yielded/agent";
import { Summarize } from "./subagent-basics.ts";
// ---cut---
const background = Subagent.background(Summarize.target, {
  start: true,
  followUp: true,
  reportToParent: true,
});
```

Give the parent `background.toolkit` and provide `background.layer` for its handlers. The
[background guide](/guide/subagents/background/) shows how findings become new input to the parent.

## Lifecycle and limits

Attached children can run concurrently, but the parent's next model call waits for the batch to
settle. A durable parent releases its execution slot while waiting and recovers the same child
after a restart. Aborting the parent propagates cancellation to attached children.

Background workers keep running after the parent finishes or aborts. Follow-ups continue the
same child thread. Durable hosts recover their accepted work and pending report delivery.

All three forms enforce permissions and budgets. Parent tools are not inherited. See the
[subagent reference](/reference/subagents/) for projections, nested delegation, and limits, or
[durability](/concepts/durability/) for recovery of uncertain external actions.
