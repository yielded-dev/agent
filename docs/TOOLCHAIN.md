# Repository toolchain

Use Vite+ for repository commands. Bun is the package manager and script runtime.
Framework packages live in `packages/*`; runnable examples live in `examples/*`.

## Versions {#source-of-truth-versions}

The root [package.json](../package.json) owns shared dependency versions.
Workspace manifests use `catalog:` for those dependencies and `workspace:*` for internal packages.
The travel planner consumes explicit Effect Agent workspace dependencies and the shared
Effect and `effect-cf` catalog versions, so it validates the current framework.
`bunfig.toml` disables implicit workspace linking, so only explicit `workspace:` dependencies
use local source; registry dependencies, including transitive ones, stay on published packages.
Commit the Bun lockfile; CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile`.

| Tool                                                    | Repository version   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Bun                                                     | `1.4.2`              |
| Vite+                                                   | `0.3.3`              |
| Alchemy and its Cloudflare runtime                      | `2.0.0-beta.80`      |
| Effect and its provider/platform/SQL/Atom/test packages | `4.0.0`              |
| `effect-cf`                                             | `0.53.0`             |
| TypeScript                                              | `7.0.2`              |
| `@effect/tsgo`                                          | `0.45.0`             |
| Node.js                                                 | `22.18+` or `24.11+` |

Public packages require `effect@^4.0.0` as a peer. The exact catalog pin supplies the
development version. Raise the peer minimum when code needs a newer API.
Private examples declare Effect as a regular dependency. Adapters depend on the platform and
SQL implementations they use.

`platform-cloudflare` requires `effect-cf@^0.53.0` and `effect@^4.0.0` as host peers
and uses the exact catalog versions for development. Supply Effect SQL packages compatible with
4.0.0 for `effect-cf`. Consumers provide the shared runtime.

Root overrides keep Effect, its Node/browser platforms, shared SQL adapters, and test packages
on the catalog versions, including dependencies of published consumers. Published consumers must use Effect's current import paths;
packages still importing `effect/unstable/*` cannot run on stable Effect.
The root also installs Alchemy's optional `@effect/platform-bun` peer at the shared Effect
version so its Bun entry points remain available.
Vite+ supplies Vitest except in the two Cloudflare packages, whose Workers pool requires a
direct catalog-pinned Vitest dependency and a Vite task. Run those tasks through `vp run`.
The repository retains Vitest 4.1.11 for the Workers pool despite `@effect/vitest` declaring
a Vitest 5 peer minimum, as it did on Effect rc.117. Verify this compatibility with the
existing suites when either dependency changes.
Operational harnesses under `tooling/*` also use Vite tasks for Miniflare tests.

The root temporarily patches Effect 4.0.0 to reuse streaming response decoders when
tool declarations stay unchanged. This applies to repository installations; published
libraries still resolve their consumer's Effect peer. Remove the patch when adopting
an upstream release containing the change.

Astro uses its own Vite dependency. Keep the root Vite+ core alias required by Vite+;
do not add a global Vite override.

Alchemy is deployment tooling; framework packages do not depend on it at runtime.
Alchemy and its Cloudflare runtime advance together. Their published beta.80 packages and
Distilled rc.13 clients support stable Effect 4 directly, without repository compatibility
patches. Verify upgrades with a frozen install and `vp run check:deploy`.

The demo uses Auth beta.11 and its compatible Drizzle, GitHub, and crypto companions,
which support stable Effect directly. Verify auth upgrades with the existing integration checks
and review their changelogs for API and stored-format changes.

## Current workspace

See the [package map](src/content/docs/reference/packages.md) for public packages and capabilities.

| `docs/`                            | Astro Starlight site using `@yielded/starlight-theme`     |

Framework code stays in `packages/*`. The canonical app and operational harnesses are leaf workspaces.
Provider integrations come from upstream Effect AI Layers, including `@effect/ai-typesafe`.
`ai-decision` owns thread model selection and consumes Effect's native `Decision` and `DecisionModel`.

```text
@yielded/agent <- storage-sql <- storage-sqlite / storage-postgres / storage-cloudflare
@yielded/agent <- storage-memory
@yielded/agent <- workflow
@yielded/agent + selected adapters <- platform packages
@yielded/agent <- sandbox-local
@yielded/agent <- testing
@yielded/agent <- pr-review
```

Within `packages/effect-agent/src`, dependencies point inward:
`core <- engine <- capabilities <- durable` and `core <- sandbox <- capabilities`.
Public module paths address these implementations directly; source directories are not separate
packages. Keep core and sandbox contracts platform-neutral. The export check enforces these
internal boundaries as well as package imports.

Arrows point toward dependencies. An inward package must not import an outward one.
The testing package consumes `ai-decision` as a devDependency for model integration fixtures.
Shared compiler settings live in `tsconfig.base.json`.

Use `vp run <task>` for other scripts. Do not use `bun run`, `npm run`, `pnpm run`,
`yarn run`, or invoke the wrapped compiler, formatter, linter, or test runner directly.
Include `vp env doctor` output when asking for toolchain help.

Local tests run with at most four workspace tasks at once and without dependency ordering.
CI gives the travel planner, context-continuity evaluation, runtime benchmark, Node platform,
testing package, and both Cloudflare packages separate runners. The remaining workspace suites
share one runner and run sequentially. Each suite keeps its own Vitest/workerd worker limits;
running more heavy suites on one runner can starve ownership-lease renewals in crash tests.
Builds follow dependency order. Process-kill and adapter contract suites are part of
the ordinary test command.

Vite Task caches successful results against their inputs. Vitest's mutable result cache is
disabled so it does not invalidate task caching. CI uses `setup-vp` for the pinned toolchain and
package-manager cache, then restores `node_modules/.vite/task-cache` after installation.
Task caches are scoped by job, operating system, and architecture; Vite Task fingerprints source,
manifests, dependency files, and lockfiles itself. Live Postgres checks remain uncached.

Tests and builds exclude generated Vite, Astro, and Wrangler paths from their inputs where those
paths would prevent reuse on fresh runners. Builds restore their outputs, including the docs site
and Action bundle. Failed tasks are never cached; successful siblings are saved even when a job
fails. A version-only manifest change can still invalidate tasks: exports, module type, and
dependency declarations must remain tracked.

Use `vp run -v test` for cache decisions, `vp run --last-details` for the previous run,
or `vp run --no-cache test` to rerun every suite.

## Postgres tests

The Postgres adapter and its certification runner need a reachable server. Set
`EFFECT_AGENT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` to select one; it defaults to a local server on port 55432.
Each case creates and drops its own database, so the server needs no preparation.

CI runs the adapter against Postgres 16 and 18, and the certification suite against 17.

## Live credentials

Local live model calls and evaluations read provider keys, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, from the
environment. Export them directly, or load them from the project's Infisical environment if you
have been granted its machine identity. Infisical access is selective; not every maintainer has it.

With access, your shell provides the identity as `INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and
`INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. Use it rather than a personal `infisical login`, which can
select an organization that does not own the project and then fails with 403. A machine identity
needs an explicit project ID for the project in `.infisical.json`, environment `dev`:

```sh
export INFISICAL_TOKEN="$(infisical login --method=universal-auth --silent --plain)"
infisical run --projectId="$(bun -p 'require("./.infisical.json").workspaceId')" --env=dev -- <command>
```

That environment holds model provider keys only. The hosted checkout proof also needs the Cloudflare
values listed in [its README](../tooling/browser-run-worker-proof/README.md#run). CI reads repository
secrets instead.

## Documentation examples

Lead implementation guides with a short, concrete code example after at most one introductory
sentence. Explain behavior after the code it describes. Keep complete setup available and
type-check examples through their runnable entry points; move advanced contracts and recovery
details into linked reference pages instead of front-loading them in walkthroughs.

Public pages live in `docs/src/content/docs`; contributor material stays outside that collection.
The homepage loads `docs/snippets/travel-planner/*.ts` through source-backed code fences.
Edit those files to change its examples. A `twoslash` fence enables type hovers and compiler
validation during `vp run docs:build`. Relative imports resolve from that snippet directory.

Twoslash uses the pinned `typescript-twoslash` JavaScript compiler API. The docs workspace uses
the compatible TypeScript 6 compiler from the root `docs` catalog; library checks use
TypeScript 7. Expressive Code runs Twoslash before highlighting each marked block. Production builds
reuse compiler and filesystem state within the process. Each build starts empty;
the dev server disables these caches so imported snippet edits remain visible.
Keep compiler validation enabled. Do not suppress errors with `noErrors` or
`noErrorValidation`.

Keep `yield*` inside a generator, such as `Effect.gen(function* () { ... })`.
Outside a generator, the formatter parses `*` as multiplication and inserts spaces.

## Link previews

The docs config adds Open Graph and Twitter metadata to the built HTML. Each page uses its
resolved title and description, a canonical URL on `https://yielded.dev/agent/`, and its own
1200 × 630 PNG. `docs/integrations/social-renderer.ts` renders the page title, description, and URL
using the installed IBM Plex fonts and `docs/public/mark.svg`. The build writes images under
`docs/dist/social/`; no browser, remote font request, or manual screenshot is needed.
Preview crawlers read the metadata and images without JavaScript.

Edit the renderer to change the artwork, or the page's frontmatter to change its title and
description. The build fails if text cannot fit at the minimum font size. Section fragments such
as `#workflow` are not sent to the server, so they share their parent page's preview. A section
needs its own page URL to have a distinct preview.
Link to `guide/workflows` for the Effect Workflows preview. The old `platforms/node#workflow`
anchor points readers to that guide.

Run `vp run docs:build` and inspect the generated HTML for the homepage, a guide, and a directory
index such as `docs/dist/platforms/index.html`. Open their generated PNGs to check the layout. Image URLs
must be absolute, and canonical URLs must match the site's clean routes. Existing messages may
retain a cached preview after a deployment.

## Documentation deployment

`vp run docs:deploy --yes` keeps the existing `effect-agent` production stack and
`effect-agent-docs` Worker, serving the docs at `yielded.dev/agent/`. The Worker
route is `yielded.dev/agent*` and the assets base is `/agent/`. The legacy domain
`effect-agent.com` remains attached and redirects each path to its equivalent
under `/agent`, preserving query strings. Retain the domain and redirects.

## Releasing to npm

All thirteen public packages share one Changesets fixed group and publish to `beta`
as `X.Y.Z-beta.N`. Keep the group in `.changeset/config.json` aligned with public workspaces.
The travel planner is a private application with no package version. It does not receive
changesets, version bumps, changelogs, package tags, or npm releases. Private-package versioning
and tagging remain disabled in the Changesets configuration.
Changesets updates internal dependency ranges only when they use `workspace:`. Exact registry
pins stay unchanged during
versioning. Upgrade those consumers and their import paths separately after publication; otherwise the version task's
install would request packages that have not been published yet.
The project is in prerelease mode. Leaving it requires an explicit release decision and
`vp run changeset pre exit`. Inspect pending changes with
`vp run changeset status`. Consumed beta notes live in `.changeset/pre/`;
`pre.json` keeps only the prerelease mode and tag. Retain the archived notes
for the stable release.

Use `vp run changeset` to describe a consumer-visible change.
Each push to `main` starts `.github/workflows/release.yml` updating the version PR alongside
source CI. The version PR reuses a completed source baseline when available and otherwise runs
ordinary CI; its `ready` check still requires every gate.
After that PR merges and its exact main revision passes CI, the workflow publishes through npm
trusted publishing with provenance. PR updates and publication use separate queues.

```text
main push ──┬──► source CI
            └──► version PR ──► CI + release gates ──► ready ──► merge
merged main ──► CI ──► release:plan ──► gates only if the tree is not the gated head ──► npm
```

The paid release gates run on the version PR, before merge, from
`.github/workflows/release-gates.yml`. Each gate is its own job, so rerunning failed jobs repeats
only the failed gate. The `ready` check records their result, and a failed or missing gate blocks
the merge. After merge, `release:plan` checks npm for unpublished public versions. If all versions
already exist, nothing runs. Otherwise it reuses the gate result only when the merged commit
belongs to the version PR and has exactly that PR head's tree. Any other tree, such as a version
PR merged while behind `main`, runs both gates again before publication. Registry failures stop
the attempt. Missing credentials, incomplete runs, model failures, or failed assertions fail a gate.

For the [context continuity evaluation](../tooling/context-continuity-eval/README.md), configure
`OPENAI_API_KEY` as a repository secret and optionally `CONTEXT_EVAL_MODEL`
as a repository variable; the workflow explicitly selects `gpt-6-astra` by default. Each suite has a
conservative $10 spending limit. Nightly and release gate jobs select one existing explicit-rollover
profile; manual dispatch may select one bounded SQLite pressure/restart profile. Cloudflare and
full-capacity coverage require separate explicit preparation. Ordinary PR checks are deterministic and
never call a model.
Each attempt preserves its own evidence artifact, including failures. This gate proves the
documented continuity scenario; it does not certify large-history startup or Cloudflare host
performance.

The [hosted checkout gate](../tooling/browser-run-worker-proof/README.md#ci-policy) runs one browser-agent checkout
with `gpt-6-luna`, a bound test-buyer credential, and an independently checked receipt. Checkout or cleanup failure blocks the release. Configure the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and narrow
`BROWSER_RENDERING_API_TOKEN` repository secrets and the `CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_SUBDOMAIN` variable;
it reuses `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Its report is retained for 30 days and recorded cleanup is retried after
failure or cancellation. **Manual hosted checkout** also runs on demand for a selected revision.
Only the version PR and an ungated publication trigger this paid checkout; changeset additions and
ordinary PRs do not, and CI never waits for human verification.

The release PR always runs candidate builds and the required `ready` gate. It can reuse
proven ordinary source checks through the [release metadata proof](#release-metadata-ci).
The workflow uses the existing Effect Agent GitHub App to create and update it, so those pushes trigger
PR CI. Keep the App's contents and pull-request write permissions enabled and configure
the `EFFECT_AGENT_APP_ID` and `EFFECT_AGENT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` repository secrets.
The checkout disables persisted credentials. The Changesets `version` and
`publish` actions receive the App token through `github-token`; `select-mode`
runs versioning for pending changesets and chooses publication only when there are
no pending changesets. Only the publish
job receives npm OIDC permission.

After merge, Changesets handles registry version checks, publishing, package tags, and GitHub
releases. CI transfers the exact validated package build to publication without repeating its
package checks; manual releases build locally.
The publisher temporarily prepares npm-ready manifests:
source exports point at built files, `workspace:*` dependencies use the current workspace
versions, and `catalog:` dependencies use the root catalog. All source manifests are restored
on success, failure, or interruption. npm publishes through OIDC with provenance; each package
must list `release.yml` in `yielded-dev/agent` as its trusted publisher.
New package names need a first authenticated publication before trusted publishing
can be configured. Install the release GitHub App on `yielded-dev/agent` after
transferring the repository; preserve its existing repository secrets. Keep the
old npm packages available and deprecate them only after their replacements are
published and the migration guide is live.

Changesets defaults packages with no stable release to `latest`. The adapter temporarily marks
the prerelease state as exiting while running `changeset publish --tag beta`, then restores it.
It never runs versioning in that state, so versions and the ongoing beta release train stay intact.

The release workflow does not require strict up-to-date branch rules or post a separate
`ready` check. Changesets refreshes the version PR as changes land on `main`.

For an authenticated manual release:

1. Run `vp run changeset`.
2. Run `vp run changeset:version`, then `vp install`.
3. Run `vp run ready`.
4. Supply [live credentials](#live-credentials) and the [checkout environment](../tooling/browser-run-worker-proof/README.md#run)
   for the exact clean candidate. Use a fresh run ID and bound test-buyer password.
5. Run `vp run release:publish --dry-run`, then
   `EFFECT_AGENT_LIVE=1 vp run --no-cache release:checked-publish`.
   Add `--otp <code>` if npm requests it.
6. Run `git push --follow-tags` to push the tags created by Changesets.

Use `release:publish` so npm receives built exports and resolved dependencies.
Its dry run builds and inspects packages without publishing or creating tags.
All public packages use the MIT license.

## Script runners

Package scripts use Bun through `vp run`.
Scripts that import `@yielded/agent-storage-sqlite` continue to use
`node --experimental-transform-types` to exercise the Node host runtime.
Strip-only execution cannot handle the framework's runtime namespaces.
This includes `admin:durable` and the Node crash workers.

## Post-install setup

`vp install` runs `vp config --no-agent --hooks-dir .vite-hooks` through `prepare`.
Apply the compiler patch separately with `vp run patch:tsgo`.
The pinned upstream command selects a replacement for the installed TypeScript version and
fails if that replacement is unavailable. Dependency versions live in the root catalog.

CI suppresses lifecycle scripts, then explicitly patches the compiler in jobs that check, test,
or build TypeScript. Read installed Effect sources in `node_modules/effect`.

`preferTypedSchemaDecoder` is enabled as a warning in `tsconfig.base.json` and fails
typechecks when an unknown-input decoder discards a known encoded type. Use the typed
decoder when the input matches the Schema's `Encoded` type; keep unknown-input decoders
at untyped boundaries. Both forms perform the same runtime validation.

The config also enforces direct Effect combinators for selective error recovery,
collection traversal, conditional validation, Option conversion, single-service provision,
timeout recovery, and Exit runners. Prefer these built-in operations when they preserve
the existing error channels, concurrency, interruption, and resource lifetime. Other style
suggestions remain advisory; synchronous Schema codecs are not prohibited globally.

To upgrade Effect:

1. Update all Effect-family catalog entries together.
2. Run `vp install`.
3. Run `vp run ready`, including canonical application compilation.
4. Run applicable opt-in provider checks with host credentials.
5. Commit the catalog and lockfile together.

## Contributor agent skills

`.agents/skills` contains repo-owned Dev Kit skills, tracked by individual
`.dev-kit-origin.json` receipts and linked from `.claude/skills`.

- Check updates with `bunx @danieljvdm/dev-kit@latest skills status`.
- Update an unmodified skill with `bunx @danieljvdm/dev-kit@latest skills update <name>`.
- Add an approved skill with `bunx @danieljvdm/dev-kit@latest skills add <name>`.

The CLI leaves locally edited skills for an agent merge. Use the `dev-kit` skill before
changing these files. Contributor skills are tooling; framework packages must not import them.

## Adding a package

Get owner agreement before adding a new framework concern.

1. Add `packages/<name>/package.json`, `src/index.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`.
2. Match sibling manifests: MIT license, public publishing, and source-first exports.
3. Add the package to the Changesets fixed group and configure its npm trusted publisher.
4. Use `catalog:` and `workspace:*` dependencies with the required inward direction.
5. Extend `tsconfig.base.json` and add a root `tsconfig.json` project reference.
6. Add applicable `check`, `test`, and `build` tasks and update the guides.
7. Run `vp run ready`.

`vp run build` dispatches `vp pack`. A package-level Vite config overrides zero-config pack
defaults, so declare `dts` and `sourcemap` there when needed.

## Exports and entry points

Follow the pinned Effect package's module layout. Package roots and public groups use namespace
exports such as `export * as Agent from "./Agent.ts"`; explicit named conveniences are also
allowed, as Effect does for `pipe` and `flow`. Public namespaces and source filenames use
PascalCase; public import subpaths use kebab-case. `import { Agent } from "@yielded/agent"` and
`import * as Agent from "@yielded/agent/agent"` select the same module.

- Lead documentation examples with named namespace imports from package roots, such as
  `import { NodeDurableHost } from "@yielded/agent-platform-node"`. Use kebab-case subpaths for
  individual declarations such as services, schemas, or types; direct module and lazy-loading examples; and specialized
  adapters or runtime-specific helpers. In particular, Node-safe Cloudflare helpers must use
  their dedicated subpaths rather than the Workers package root.
- Keep implementations in named modules. A public module exposes every declaration it exports;
  move sibling-only helpers into private files. A small, explicit public selector may expose
  supported declarations from a private implementation without exposing its helpers.
- Import sibling implementations relatively and directly. Do not route them through the package's
  own public entry points or index barrels. Re-export-only files under `internal/` add no public
  boundary and should be removed.
- Import other framework packages through their declared public entry points. Direct modules,
  roots, and namespace groups are allowed; declare the dependency and respect package direction.
- Keep one implementation owner for each API. Deliberate public modules may forward another
  package's bindings, including with `export *`, as Effect's platform packages do. A namespace
  group such as `/testing` is also a valid public boundary. Review additions for consumer value;
  avoid accumulating overlapping aliases without a reason.
- Keep test-only groups and modules under `/testing` or `/testing/module`, excluded from production
  entry points. Optional browser adapters and fixtures may remain direct-only imports.
- Keep `package.json` exports explicit, with matching pack entries. Exports may address nested
  source modules directly, such as `./agent` mapping to `./src/core/Agent.ts`; no forwarding file
  is needed. Pack preserves paths relative to `src`, and the publisher maps them to `dist`.
  Do not publish wildcard, `internal`, or `index` subpaths.

See the [package map](src/content/docs/reference/packages.md#public-imports) for API ownership and import changes.

Oxlint enforces export-only root and group indexes, prevents self-barrel imports, and rejects
re-export-only internal files during `vp lint`, `vp check`, and the pre-commit hook. Indexes may
contain namespace and explicit named re-exports, but not bare wildcard exports or implementation
code. Public forwarding modules need no umbrella-specific exception or file allowlist.

The export check in `vp run check` verifies manifest paths, exact filename casing, namespace
targets, pack entries, declared workspace dependencies, and the inward-only source layers within
`@yielded/agent`. The purity check uses declared testing
targets as well as known test-module paths to prevent production entry points from reaching
test-only code. Choosing supported APIs and useful public groups still requires review.

Audited packages declare `"sideEffects": []`, as Effect does, so bundlers can discard unused
modules. This describes import-time behavior, not whether exported operations perform effects.
Keep I/O and registration inside Effects and Layers. Recheck the declaration when adding an
import-time initializer or upgrading a dependency with startup behavior. The Cloudflare platform
package remains unmarked because its optional Puppeteer adapters patch globals on import.

## Bundle size comparisons

Pull requests that change package code, build tooling, or dependencies run the **Bundle size**
workflow against the exact base and head commits. Prose and site-only changes skip it.
Like [Effect's bundle check](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/tools/bundle),
it bundles small consumer fixtures against built packages. Each checkout installs its own
lockfile and keeps its own Vite Task cache: the checkout paths produce different command fingerprints.
The comparison uses the PR's esbuild version and the same fixture source for both sides.
Disposable comparison manifests alias historical PascalCase subpaths to their kebab-case names;
staged modules also expose the former `Ephemeral` assembly as `InMemory`. The published packages
retain only their canonical exports. Renamed modules remain comparable.
For Effect prerelease baselines, the analyzer resolves the fixtures' `effect/ai`
import to that checkout's original `effect/unstable/ai` implementation.

The fixtures in `scripts/bundle` cover agent construction, importing the runtime's `run` function,
the in-memory assembly, and loading the runtime on demand, through both root and direct module imports. The
analyzer stages copies of `dist` and uses the release publisher's manifest conversion. It does
not bundle workspace source or externalize Effect. It uses minified ESM, a browser target,
`es2022`, production mode, and gzip level 9 per emitted chunk.

**Initial** counts the entry and every statically reachable shared chunk. **Deferred** counts
the remaining output, and **total** counts each chunk once. These are byte measurements, not
startup timing or a promise about another bundler. Newly introduced modules show `n/a`
for the base. Build failures fail the report; size increases are informational.

Use direct module paths at lazy-loading boundaries. With the measured esbuild configuration,
statically importing `Agent` from the root and dynamically importing `AgentRuntime` from the same
root pulls the runtime into the initial chunk. Direct `@yielded/agent/agent` and
`@yielded/agent/agent-runtime` imports preserve a deferred runtime chunk; shared Effect dependencies
still count toward the initial load.

The comparison also bundles and executes `runtime-smoke.ts` against the PR's staged packages.
This Node check verifies root/direct bindings and a deterministic agent run after minification
and tree shaking. It is excluded from browser byte totals, and failure prevents a success report.

To reproduce locally, install dependencies and run `vp run -F './packages/*' build` in each
checkout, then run from the PR checkout:

```sh
vp run bundle:compare -- --base-dir /path/to/base-checkout
```

`.bundle-report/report.md` contains the table; `report.json` contains exact raw/gzip bytes,
revisions, Effect versions, and chunk membership. Each fixture also gets emitted `.mjs` files,
an esbuild `meta.json`, and `modules.txt` with module contributions. The metafile can be opened
in [esbuild's analyzer](https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/). CI attaches these as `bundle-stats`
and `bundle-analysis` artifacts and updates one PR comment through a separate trusted workflow.
The comment workflow becomes active after it is merged into the default branch.

## Runtime performance comparisons

Run the **Runtime performance** workflow manually from Actions. Choose baseline and candidate
refs, a workload profile, and optionally individual cases. Refs resolve to exact commits before
checkout; leaving the baseline blank compares the latest published release with the candidate
(main by default). The candidate supplies the shared benchmark fixture. There are no scheduled
or push-triggered performance runs.

The [scripted benchmark](../tooling/runtime-benchmark/README.md) runs identical fixture bytes
against production builds and each revision's own lockfile on the same Node runtime. Locally,
`vp run perf:compare --list-cases` and `vp run perf:diagnose --list-cases` list the workloads without
running them. Repeat `--case` to focus a comparison on the component under investigation:

```sh
vp run perf:compare --base-dir /path/to/base --case checkpoint-recovery-2048 --out-dir /tmp/recovery-comparison
vp run perf:compare --base-dir /path/to/base --steady-state-profile --case sqlite-tool-rounds-4 --out-dir /tmp/sqlite-profile
```

`--steady-state-profile` captures one warmed operation loop inside a resident file-backed SQLite
host per revision. It performs exactly 500 warmup operations, then
captures 1,000 fresh-Thread operations, each with four immediate tool calls and five provider
requests. Imports, host acquisition, warmup, reporting, and host disposal are outside capture.
The provider uses native `Stream.make`, so this is a diagnostic workload distinct from async-iterable
delivery and the ordinary reopen-per-sample matrix. Select the workflow's
`steady_state_profile` input to run it in Actions.

`--cpu-profile` remains whole-process profiling, including imports and setup; diagnostics support
that mode only. Both modes suppress timing comparisons. Use profiles to locate work, then rerun
an unprofiled matched workload to measure a change. Timing tasks bypass the task cache; keep
other builds, tests, and benchmarks idle during measurement.

The bounded `pr` profile covers small runs and streams, fixed-size responses with increasing fragmentation,
growing prompts, parallel tools and repeated rounds, file-backed SQLite history, checkpoint
recovery, and settled Submission ledgers. Fresh durable startup includes reopening the host and
admission; recovery of an existing Run is a separate case. First-model timing ends in the actual
provider callback. A separate subprocess measurement includes startup and fixture imports.
Retain raw samples, failures, environment metadata, fixture and artifact hashes, and exact SHAs.
Manual workflow results appear in the run summary and downloadable artifact.

Latency reports are informational until repeated CI runs establish variance and useful absolute
and relative thresholds. Deterministic call, concurrency, ownership, tracing, and history-work
budgets remain correctness gates. The fresh-submission history guard permits two linear scans plus
fixed work for histories without compaction. Compacted and checkpoint-seeded views keep their
canonical validation. Eligible sequential Runs after compaction can reuse certified Thread
context, but fallback and new compaction still traverse canonical history. Measure fresh-Run
settlement as well as provider entry to include checkpoint refresh work.
Fairness, lock contention, optional
memory/MCP publication, and large settled-ledger indexing require their own controlled evidence
before changing those paths.

The separate [manual Cloudflare evaluation](../tooling/context-continuity-eval/README.md#manual-deployed-performance-evaluation)
deploys real model-and-tool workloads through the public HTTP/DO host. Use `vp run perf:cloudflare
--dry-run` to inspect the deployment plan without credentials. The workflow accepts exact commits
and runs only on explicit dispatch with its dedicated environment credentials. Its bounded fresh,
warm, and recovery cases assert consumed tool results, validated output, canonical settlement,
same-thread continuity, and cleanup. Preserve failure artifacts and retry any recorded cleanup
before closing an attempt. Offline workerd tests validate the harness, not deployed latency.

For replay and compaction CPU without inference, use the separate
[scripted Cloudflare comparison](../tooling/context-continuity-eval/README.md#scripted-cloudflare-cpu-comparison).
`vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu:build` builds a clean revision; `vp run perf:cloudflare:cpu`
compares two bundles through disposable Alchemy stages with an identical-code control,
three deployment rounds, separate initial/warmed cycles and invocation CPU exports.
This manual command has its own bounded workload and verified cleanup.

Compare matched workloads and clock domains. Local scripted timings do not measure provider
latency, Cloudflare CPU billing, or provider cache effects. A live report identifies what it can
observe and must accompany claims about the exact candidate and configuration it measured.

## CI and hooks

Every PR runs CI and reports the required `ready` result. CI selects work from the complete PR
diff, including both paths of a rename:

- Prose, contributor skills, and auxiliary workflows require formatting and workflow validation.
- Site documentation requires those checks plus docs linting, types, build, and link validation.
- Source, dependencies, shared tooling, CI execution policy, and unclassified paths require all
  static checks, test suites, and builds.

Missing, truncated, or stale file listings select the full gate. `ready` accepts only the skips
selected by a successful classification; a failed or cancelled required job still fails the gate.
Changesets release PRs retain their complete release checks. Main pushes run the full gate to
provide release evidence and populate shared caches.

Static checks include `check:deploy`, which invokes both deployment entry points with `--help`
and imports both stack files using a temporary Alchemy profile. This catches missing dependencies
and incompatible Effect APIs without credentials or infrastructure changes; it does not verify
Cloudflare credentials or remote deployment. Deployment tasks disable Vite Task caching so every
invocation runs and receives its deployment environment.
Cloudflare storage, Cloudflare platform, Node platform, and testing have dedicated test runners.
The remaining-workspace job includes every other package and runs one package task at a time.

CI retries individual timeout failures twice, one second apart. Cloudflare suites instead retry
the entire task once after any failure: their worker pool keeps Object storage between cases, so
a test retry could inherit a failed attempt's state. Other assertion failures fail immediately.
Installation gets at most two attempts. Check and build commands, including the test-runner
process, get one retry after their own deadline or forced termination. The command deadline
applies to the process group, and the job deadline leaves room for both attempts. Persistent
failures still fail CI.

The generated Changesets PR uses the release metadata proof below, with ordinary CI as its fallback.
Explicit `@effect-agent review` comments still request review.

PR Review follows completed pull-request CI runs using `workflow_run` and runs only
trusted default-branch code. It starts after CI succeeds or fails; cancelled runs do
not start reviews. Drafts and generated release metadata remain excluded.
It publishes the shared `Effect Agent review` check on the inspected PR head using the workflow
token's `checks: write` permission. Automatic and manual reviews use the same check name;
manual retries show progress in the PR checks panel. Published findings and incomplete coverage
fail that check, while setup, execution, and check publication failures also fail the workflow job.
Maintainers and authorized coding agents can clear a fixed or refuted bot review by commenting
`@effect-agent dismiss <review-id-or-url>` with evidence on subsequent lines. The command records
the disposition and refreshes the check without inference; other blockers and incomplete coverage
remain blocking. See [dismissal and CLI usage](../action/README.md#dismissing-a-review).
See the [Action check configuration](../action/README.md#pr-check-status) for consumer setup.
For fork PRs that require GitHub workflow approval, click **Approve workflows to run**
once on the PR. CI runs first, then PR Review starts without a separate environment
approval. The `pr-review` environment is used for all reviews and must have no required
reviewers. The old `pr-review-forks` environment is no longer used.
Approving CI does not give the CI job repository secrets.

The workflow resolves the PR through GitHub's API and checks that the CI run belongs to
this repository and its head still matches the open, non-draft PR. The Action's
expected-head check also skips a review if the PR changes after that resolution.
Comment-triggered reviews retain their maintainer authorization and do not wait for CI.
Never check out, install dependencies from, or execute the PR head in this secret-bearing
workflow; the reviewer reads untrusted source through GitHub's API instead. CI artifacts
and caches are not consumed by the review workflow.

Each cacheable test-matrix job has its own task-cache key. Docs-only builds and candidate bundle
builds reuse the build cache; base comparisons keep a separate cache. Dependency installation
always precedes task-cache restoration.
Proven version merges reuse their source checks and exact PR build. The `ready` fan-in runs on PRs and manually dispatched branch CI. Main runs are not cancelled
by newer pushes. GitHub scopes PR caches to each PR's merge ref, so another PR cannot reuse them.
A new release PR can restore the latest main results only after those jobs finish saving their
caches. Waiting for those caches alone does not prevent version fields from invalidating whole-file
task fingerprints. Ordinary task results are reused only when task inputs match.

### Release metadata CI {#release-metadata-ci}

`scripts/release-ci.ts` reuses static checks and all ten test-matrix gates from ordinary
`CI` on the exact source base, both on the version PR and after its merge. The verifier and its
dependencies run from that base, with read-only contents, Actions and pull-request permissions.
Candidate files are read as Git objects; the proof does not execute candidate code.

```text
main push -> ordinary source CI and version PR in parallel
version PR -> proof or ordinary CI + build + package checks
successful source + PR CI -> version merge: proof + restore PR build + package checks
successful main CI -> publication: restore main build + reuse or rerun release gates -> npm
```

The supported delta is deliberately narrow: every public package in the single fixed group
advances by one beta number, changelogs prepend the corresponding entry without rewriting history,
and `bun.lock` changes only the matching workspace version fields. Manifests and the lockfile
must otherwise remain byte-identical. Every pending changeset must move from
`.changeset/` to `.changeset/pre/` with identical contents and file mode.
Prerelease mode and tag, previously archived notes, dependencies, exports, scripts,
module type, source, tests, configuration and workflow policy cannot change.
Stable releases, other prerelease transitions and unfamiliar layouts run ordinary CI.

The proof checks the current PR head and base, current `main`, the synthetic merge commit's exact
two parents, and equality of the merge and head trees. It queries the latest base push run of
the identified CI workflow, requiring a completed successful run and successful ordinary
command steps for static checks, every test suite and the build. Evidence is bound to its run
ID and attempt, then rechecked along with the PR revisions. A skipped command, missing job,
partial API page, changing attempt, policy change, API failure or 45-second proof timeout selects ordinary
CI. Setup failures also fall back. The summary records the immutable revisions and evidence run.
Only main-push source validation can authorize reuse; fast-path PR results never authorize another
fast path. No manifest or lockfile is globally excluded from Vite Task inputs.

The version PR still receives a frozen install, all package/example/docs/Action builds, formatting,
export and purity checks, and `ci:release-packages`. Main repeats the frozen install, formatting,
export, purity and package checks after restoring that exact build. Package inspection temporarily prepares the
same npm-ready manifests used by publication and runs `npm pack --dry-run --ignore-scripts`
for at most four packages concurrently, checking the actual version and every exported JavaScript
and declaration file. Source manifests and
prerelease state are restored. A failed retained check fails `ready`. This path neither publishes
nor calls paid models; the separate release gates remain required.

Release PR generation runs on `push` alongside main CI and skips superseded main revisions.
If ordinary source CI is still running when the PR proof checks it, the PR runs ordinary CI.
Publication alone uses `workflow_run: completed` after successful main CI and skips commits with
pending changesets. Because Changesets uses `github.sha` internally, publication requires that
SHA to equal the completed run's head; a newer main revision waits for its own CI.
An already stale PR or changed merge tree also falls back to ordinary CI. Evidence applies only to the
recorded merge checkout, just as ordinary PR checks do; it does not validate later base movement
or replace branch protection's up-to-date requirements.

A version merge must belong to the single merged Changesets PR, have its recorded base as the
previous main revision, and have exactly the PR head's tree. Squash and two-parent merges are
supported; changed bases, merge resolutions and other topologies select ordinary CI. The proof
rechecks ordinary source CI and the latest successful version-PR CI attempt, including its actual
build, package checks and `ready` command. It never chains source approval through another fast path.

Each build uploads one `release-build-<run>-<attempt>` artifact containing package `dist` files and
the Action bundle, bound to its Git tree, commit and parents. Consumers check the authenticated
GitHub artifact identity and SHA-256 of the complete archive before decoding it, then check the
recorded revisions and file hashes. Only generated build paths can be restored. Main records the
restored build under its own identity after package validation. Documentation and example outputs
are not transferred, but their successful exact-tree build remains required evidence.

Publication accepts only the successful exact revision and CI attempt selected by `workflow_run`.
It re-fetches an unavailable or unsuccessful jobs listing at most twice, five seconds apart;
each read must independently prove every required gate for that same run and attempt. A final
job-proof error names the gate, expected run and revision, and observed job/step states.
It rechecks that evidence before preparation and after the live gate. Later `main` commits can
advance during the gate if the tested revision remains an ancestor and public package manifests
and prerelease configuration have not changed; another version release blocks publication.
Main rebuilds if the PR artifact cannot be restored. Publication fails on
missing, expired, corrupt or mismatched artifacts; they never authorize publication. Artifact
retention is seven days; rerun main CI to replace expired evidence.
The fresh paid gate, Changesets registry checks, npm OIDC provenance and Action tag publication
remain required. Local controlled proofs establish correctness; hosted release latency needs a
matched version-merge run.

The pre-commit hook runs `vp check --fix` on staged JavaScript and TypeScript.
The full CI gate includes package type checks and the Action build.

Action bundles use the catalog-pinned esbuild. `vp run action:build` writes ignored
output to `action/dist/index.mjs` and checks its Node.js syntax. The root build task
also builds the Action, so source PRs validate bundling without committing generated
JavaScript. There is no bundle freshness check or input-hash manifest.

On successful `main` runs, CI publishes the exact build artifact in a child commit
of the validated source. It creates `action-<source-commit-sha>` and advances
`action-v1` in one atomic push, without changing `main`. Only the publication job
has repository write permission; it installs no dependencies and runs no project
code. Superseded source commits are skipped, and a Git lease prevents competing
publishers from overwriting a newer channel. Failed publication preserves the last
release and can be retried by rerunning the failed CI job.

Consumers use `yielded-dev/agent/action@action-v1` or pin the distribution
commit SHA printed in the CI summary. New source commits and `@main` no longer
contain a runnable bundle; older SHA pins still work. Before the initial cutover, seed `action-v1` with the
last validated source commit that still contains the bundle, then migrate existing
workflows. The first successful main CI run publishes the new distribution commits.
These tags are independent of npm package releases.
